        Nuking Permission Errors on El Capitan
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2016</span>

    <p>I have a home server running El Capitan (10.11.5). The other day when a cron job failed to send out some emails, I took a look and was <strong>horrified</strong> to find my Desktop folder (yes, I have my source code folder on the Desktop) had its <strong>permissions totally borked</strong>.</p>

<p>I tried the usual solutions: ran Software Update, restarted (twice), chmod-ed everything, tried modifying permissions from the Get Info pop-up, ran Disk Utility’s First Aid, <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2015/11/04/verify-repair-permissions-mac-os-x/">repaired disk permissions</a> from the command line (El Capitan removed this from Disk Utility for some reason), and <a href="http://kb.parallels.com/en/120432">reset home folder permissions and ACLs</a> (access control lists not anterior cruciate ligament). <strong>None of this did the trick.</strong></p>

<p>In desperation <strong>I took to the internet to find random things to paste into the command line</strong>, preferably with <strong>sudo</strong> in it! I saw <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5182705?start=0&amp;tstart=0">a post on Apple’s help forums</a> by Linc Davis; I’ve seen him post plenty of helpful things in the past and he is Level 10 with 204,169 points which is a lot of credibility points in my book. His solution was to paste this bad boy (which unlocks all your user files and resets their ownership and ACLs to defaults) into the command line:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">{</span> sudo chflags -R nouchg,nouappnd ~ <span class="nv">$TMPDIR</span>.. ; sudo chown -R <span class="nv">$UID</span>:staff ~ <span class="nv">$_</span> ; sudo chmod -R u+rwX ~ <span class="nv">$_</span> ; chmod -R -N ~ <span class="nv">$_</span> ; <span class="o">}</span> 2&gt; /dev/null</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>And it worked!</strong> Thanks, Linc!</p>

<p>I’ll keep this bad boy around for the inevitable future permissions mishaps. And I also discovered a new requirement for anything I paste into the command line: piping the output of standard error to /dev/null blackhole (i.e. 2&gt; /dev/null)!</p>

        StarCraft - Bad Weather Co-op Mission Tips
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2016</span>

    <p>In a recent update to the cooperative (co-op) game mode in StarCraft 2, Blizzard introduced <strong>mutation challenges</strong>. Mutations change every week and take an existing mission and add mutations to it. Mutations are essentially handicaps like reduced vision for your units, enemy speed increased, and other things that generally make the mission more difficult.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;" src="/assets/images/posts/2016-06-06/mutations.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Why yes! I thought exactly that!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>This week’s mutation challenge <strong>Bad Weather</strong> is incredibly challenging (seemingly impossible at first) on Brutal difficulty. A mutation causes Void Rifts to periodically appear in random locations and these rifts spawn enemy units until destroyed. If you don’t take care of the Void Rifts quickly, you’ll easily get overwhelmed.</p>

<p>But the mission is do-able! Spencer and I beat it using Karax and Vorazun. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Karax will one-base the whole game</strong>. The Vorazun player should expand as early as possible and let Karax handle early attacks. Holding the right expansion seems a bit easier so have your party leader be Karax (leader spawns in the left position).</li>
  <li>Karax focuses exclusively on <strong>base defense the entire game</strong>. Build Photon Cannons, Khaydarin Monoliths, and Shield Batteries.</li>
  <li>Karax should get the <strong>Solar Forge efficiency upgrades</strong> because Orbital Strike and Solar Lance are helpful in tight spots.</li>
  <li>Use Vorazun’s Shadow Guard to take out the first Void Shard and if you’re lucky, snipe one or two Void Rifts.</li>
  <li>Vorazun should expand early and go <strong>mass Dark Templar</strong> (DT). You’ll be lacking anti-air, but with high DPS and Blink, DTs can get in, do damage, and run away from any trouble in the air. Also because of Emergency Recall any DTs that die will get recalled to your Nexus, which greatly lessens pressure on your economy.</li>
  <li>The general strategy for destroying Void Shards: once you have a handful of DTs, move out on the map and destroy Void Rifts while <strong>Time Stop</strong> is on cooldown. When Time Stop is about to be ready move towards the area where Void Shards are. When Time Stop is ready, activate it, and push onto Void Shards. Sometimes we sniped Void Shards and ran away; other times, we cleared enemies and then took out the Void Shards.</li>
  <li>When you have DTs clearing Void Rifts on the map, have Karax put down some static defense at the expansion on the left (the one Karax does not take) and have <strong>Vorazun take those gases</strong> to bring her total Assimilator count to 6. A few Photon Cannons and a Khaydarin Monolith should do the trick.</li>
</ul>

<p>It won’t be easy, but it’s do-able. I’m even tempted to try to best it again. Good luck, commanders!</p>

        Global Running Day
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2016</span>

    <p>Today is <a href="http://globalrunningday.org/">Global Running Day</a>. I’m a huge fan of running. My four mile runs every weekday wake me up physically (and mentally) and are the cornerstone to a great day.</p>

<p>I started running in college to get in better shape. I ran pretty slowly and got injured pretty quickly into my journey. Today I’m much healthier, run a little faster, can cover longer distances, and get injured less often. Post-running ice packs are a godsend! Not running feels strange now and makes me very uneasy.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever considered running as an exercise, I highly recommend you give it a shot. It’s changed my life in so many wonderful ways. And you don’t need to run fast; just run at a pace that doesn’t kill you. Before you know it, you’ll be running faster and longer distances. And soon thereafter, you’ll be hooked and call yourself a runner.</p>

        Automated SMS Via Twilio
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 May 2016</span>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago I wrote a simple email reminder program that pulled events from Google Calendar and then notified people about it with an email sent via the Gmail API. You can read more about the why and how in <a href="/2016/03/26/automated-calendar-reminders-gmail">that post</a>.</p>

<p>After getting that up and running, I quickly got a feature request: “it’d be really cool if it could send a text message too!” I’m a strong believer in ask (kindly) and you (may) receive…</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;" src="/assets/images/posts/2016-05-26/twilio.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>Setting up automated text messages was a breeze with <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>. The API is super simple and just works. And it’s pretty cheap too: $1.00 a month for a number (needed to send text messages) and under one cent ($0.0075) per text message sent.</p>

<p>The updated code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/markcerqueira/kendo-emailer">kendo-emailer on Github</a>. TwilioHelper and TwilioConfiguration are the main files to look at if you’re interested in setting up Twilio yourself.</p>

        Build, Deploy, Improve

    <p>When building something it’s easy to get hung up on how incomplete something is or how far off it is from the awesome (and complicated) idea in your head. But that shouldn’t stop you from building things and putting those things out there.</p>

<p>The concept of minimal viable product (MVP) gets thrown around a lot when people talk about their hot new idea, but I prefer building a <strong>minimally useful product</strong>. It’s not radically different; just a change in mindset. Don’t aim for building something “capable of growing or developing;” aim for building something with “<strong>a beneficial use</strong>” in version 1.0. Then, nurture and grow that beneficial use.</p>

<p>Pick a simple problem, and solve it. Then expand the scope of the problem and solve that. Rinse and repeat. Keep <strong>building</strong>. Keep <strong>deploying</strong>. Keep <strong>improving</strong>. Aiming for perfection in the first release will prevent you from ever releasing or even worse, starting to build.</p>

<p>Just remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day and your awesome idea won’t be either.</p>
