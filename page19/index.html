        Devious iPhone 6 Gigabytes
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>Storage capacities. That’s the deviously smart thing about the new iPhone 6 and larger-than-life iPhone 6 Plus.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-11/size.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>So many gigabytes!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>The “base” iPhone model has and still costs $199. Before the iPhone 6, the base iPhone model had 16 GB. You could <strong>double</strong> the capacity to 32 GB for $100, and with another $100 you could <strong>double</strong> that to 64 GB. With the new iPhone 6 models, you still pay $100 for capacity upgrades, but now your first $100 doesn’t double your capacity, it <strong>QUADRUPLES</strong> it from 16 GB to 64 GB. Another $100 on top of that <strong>JUST doubles</strong> the 64 GB to 128 GB. One day that second $100 will quadruple your 64 GB into a wonderful 256 GB.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-11/appledoge.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>I think the most devious thing is keeping the “base” iPhone 6 model at 16 GB and not making the “base” model have 32 GB in storage. It keeps costs down for Apple and will likely encourage  people to upgrade to that 64 GB model. If paying $100 to double your capacity didn’t seem appealing, paying $100 to quadruple your capacity will likely win more people over. Wow!</p>

    <span class="post-date">10 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>A few days ago, I dragged three different versions of GoToMeeting from my Applications folder to the trash. A few days later, I found myself deleting the same three copies of GoToMeeting  <strong>again</strong>. How did GoToMeeting reinstall itself? A few tweets to the helpful person behind @GoToMeeting confirmed my worst fears…</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-10/reinstall.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>GoToMeeting runs a background agent that exists outside the app bundle and automatically updates itself. Turns out, it will also reinstall the app and it will even install three different versions of itself! <strong>How annoyingly convenient!</strong></p>

<p>GoToMeeting’s instructions for disabling automatic updates involve waiting for GoToMeeting to reinstall itself and then disabling automatic updates from within the app. <strong>I REFUSE!!!</strong> I’m getting rid of this nuisance now.</p>

<p>Fortunately, cleaning up GoToMeeting permanently isn’t too difficult. It just requires killing a launch agent configuration file, but if you want to be thorough you can wipe the entire folder that contains the background updater. To the command-line!</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># if you like playing it safe, replace -f (force delete) with -i (interactive delete)</span>

<span class="c"># delete the launch agent configuration file</span>
rm -fv ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrixonline.GoToMeeting.G2MUpdate.plist

<span class="c"># delete the folder that contains the background updater</span>
rm -rfv ~/Library/Application<span class="se">\ </span>Support/CitrixOnline/</code></pre></figure>

<p>Good riddance, GoToMeeting!</p>

    <p>I like to personalize my compliments on Yelp, but I don’t overdo it. I’ll take some base like “Have a great week” and just add the person’s name to it. I think referring to someone by their name is an easy way to add a little personal touch.</p>

<p>But when I hit the Compliment button on my iOS or Android device, I run into a little snag.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-08/name.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>How do I spell my girlfriend's name again?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Crap! I don’t remember the person’s name or how to spell it properly! And it’s no where on this compliment screen. This is especially common during a “Compliment Blitzkrieg” where I send a bunch of compliments at once and names are flying around everywhere.</p>

<p>Yes. I could just go back, commit it to memory, and go back, but there is plenty of space on the compliment screen so it’d be nice if the person’s name was included. Here’s a mock-up (keyboard included!) of what it could look like:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-08/mock.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>Huzzah! That's how I spell her name!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Yelp – you could be sparing tons of relationships (from casual to intimate) from incredible awkwardness here!</p>

    <p>It all started with a <strong>clearly unassuming</strong> instant message.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-04/robot.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>It's my lucky day!!!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Seriously, sex robot!? It’s been 17 years since AOL Instant Messenger was released, and this is your best shot? Referring to me as “stud <strong>or</strong> lovely lady” and then assuring me (with improper grammar to boot) that “this is really myself” is just unbelievably lazy. Or perhaps, like email spammers, the sex robots just want really gullible people to click on their links.</p>

<p>That said, there is something pretty cool (i.e. devious) going on here. The link to this sex robot’s website contains my username as the query string (e.g. www.spamwebsite.com/<em>?username</em>). Anyone who clicks on the link will not only get some unwanted malware on their system, but will likely also get a little boost in their <strong>sex messaging susceptibility rating.</strong> If I was a sex robot and was prioritizing who to send messages to, people who clicked on sex robot links in the past are much more attractive.</p>

<p>Perhaps this sex robot isn’t so lazy after all…</p>

        Drivers Still Suck on Windows
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>It’s been a while since I used a Windows machine. While I do virtualize sometimes to run Windows-only software, I haven’t considered myself a Windows user since the summer of 2006 when I switched to a Mac. It’s been a while since I had to work with a Windows machine, but some things never change: <strong>driver installation is still a harrowing experience on Windows</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/guess.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>Milk makes your bones stronger. Drivers make your Windows PC usable.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>A friend recently bought a Windows laptop (a Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284) and wanted me to help him set it up. Setting it up involved not paying Toshiba their exorbitant cost for an SSD and installing one ourselves, upgrading the RAM, and downgrading (i.e. upgrading) from Windows 8 to Windows 7. It was somewhat of a struggle but we were able to eventually take the machine apart, upgrade to an SSD, upgrade the RAM, “acceptably” put the machine back together, and install Windows 7. Yet, the real struggle hadn’t even begun…</p>

<!--break-->

<p>A driver-less Windows machine is a pathetic thing. The display resolution is terrible, the trackpad is wonky, and connecting to a network with either Ethernet or Wi-Fi is impossible. Fortunately, laptop manufacturers have webpages for you to download drivers. Unfortunately, that’s where most of the good ends.</p>

<p>For example, downloading the driver for the Wi-Fi card presents me with the following options:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/list.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>How lucky are you feeling?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Welp, this is hard. Not only are there four <strong>different drivers for the same functional piece of hardware</strong> (i.e. Wi-Fi card), there are also <strong>multiple versions of some drivers</strong>. I’m not quite sure why Toshiba doesn’t hide the older versions. Newer should always be better right? As luck would have it, my friend’s laptop had the Realtek driver which I downloaded last because it was at the end of the list.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/mulan.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>Whooooooo makes that Wi-Fi card I cannot see?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>With Internet connectivity, Windows Update helped me out and installed a bunch of the drivers, but there were a few stragglers left. So, back I went to Toshiba’s website for <strong>a game of cat-and-mouse trying to find the missing drivers</strong>. An hour or so later, I was down to a single device – USB2.0-CRW – missing its driver. Some Google-fu revealed this was the multi-card reader, but <strong>nothing on Toshiba’s website seemed to work</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I discovered driver-installing-helping-software like Driver Easy and Driver Max that scan your computer for hardware and find the drivers for you. Huzzah! Sounds wonderful. I wish I had found it earlier! Driver Easy was easily (pun intended) able to find the USB2.0-CRW driver and install it for me.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/drivermax.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>Only $19.90 a month to unlock the MAX!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Sadly – and very maddening – Driver Easy also reported that most of the drivers I installed from Toshiba’s website were outdated. Cool! Let’s just update them all. What!? I need to buy a pro version of this software to get that awesome update all functionality? If you don’t pony up the cash not only do you not get that feature, <strong>Driver Max makes you wait 5+ minutes for each download</strong> and <strong>Driver Easy limits your download speed to 30 KB/s.</strong> Both applications also block you from downloading multiple drivers at once, so grab a drink or a few drinks.</p>

<p>Sigh…</p>
