<p>Don’t wait for 2014 to start working toward your goals – <strong>start today.</strong> I can’t run a marathon today, but I’ve got 40 weeks to sort it all out. I was one of those people who’d make resolutions on New Year’s Eve. And then by the middle of January, I’d be back to my old ways. Come the following New Year’s Eve, I’d be back to make promises I deep down inside knew I wouldn’t keep. Don’t waste any time working towards your goals. And don’t wait for a new year to get started – <strong>start today</strong>.</p>

        Taking Kickstarter to Court: Follow Up
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>Earlier this month, I did an audit of all the Kickstarter projects I backed. I found four projects to be extremely behind schedule with posting updates.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/548200252/help-support-beekeeping-bees-have-a-lot-to-teach-u">Help Support Beekeeping</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1657688528/mars-daedalus-two-a-new-realistic-sci-fi-graphic-n">Mars: Daedalus Two – A Sci-Fi Graphic Novel</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd">ANIMUSIC 3</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751892223/the-sons-of-starcraft?ref=live">The Sons of StarCraft</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I shared my findings with Kickstarter, ANIMUSIC, and Sons of StarCraft on Twitter (the other two of the projects aren’t Twitter-cool yet). After all, the Internet is made for sharing your displeasure with as many people as possible.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 680px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-19/ks_tweet.png" />
</div>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It pays to call people out when they have scumbag moments… that last over 6 months. Two of the four rotten eggs have come forward.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>1. Jeffrey Morris of the <b>Mars: Daedalus Two</b> project posted an update ten hours after the tweets were dispatched apologizing about the delay in finishing his comic. Jeffrey goes on to say:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 680px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-19/mars_qq.png" />

</div>

<div style="height: 24px;"></div>

<p>2. The <b>ANIMUSIC</b> team sent a much-needed update six days after my blog post claimed they didn't "have an ounce of freaking DECENCY." The team says they are sorry about the delays and find their backers' desire for more consistent updates understandable. And also:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 680px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-19/animusic_qq.png" />

        Who's Behind Bad UX at GOM TV?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2013</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" style="border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-14/gom.png" alt="GOM TV" /> 
  	<p>UI and UX designers battle ferociously to create something that is both beautiful (UI) and a pleasure to use (UX). When I interact with something that isn't gorgeous and functional, I blame a flaw in this holy union. When something is beautiful, but totally hard to use, I blame the UX designer. When something feels awesome to work with, but is freaking atrocious to look at, the UI designer takes the blame. But earlier this week when I went to watch some StarCraft 2 videos, I learned that behind every bad user experience, there isn't always a bad UX designer or UI designer. Sometimes, things are just out of their hands.</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p>I unabashedly admit to watching a lot of professional StarCraft. GOM TV, based out of South Korea, has been producing top notch StarCraft 2 content since September 2010 and I’ve been eating it up since then. I catch the videos on demand (VODs) of matches on the days following the actual matches. The other day I logged on to watch the 5th place decider matches. Basically, the 4 players who lost in the round of 8 were competing for the 5th place. There are two matches and the winners of those two matches proceed to a third match. The winner of that third match gets the coveted 5th place prize. When I went to the list of VODs, my experience was less than ideal.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 680px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-14/gomtv_sc2.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>What's wrong with this?</b></p>
</div>

<p>Turns out this list of videos spoils the result of a match! Recall that Match 3 will be between the winners of Match 1 and Match 2. Who’s that devilishly handsome Korean in the screenshot of Match 3? The winner of Match 1. Knowing who is going to win ahead of time ruins some of the fun of watching Match 1, yet this isn’t an issue of bad UX or UI. It is true that the screenshots themselves are a liability for mistakes like this, but without them, the list of videos would be an intimidating wall of text. Whether these screenshots are generated automatically from the video or someone manually selects the screenshot, this is a case of <strong>content negatively influencing the user experience</strong>. But if you’re hankering to blame UX designers, you can always play the blame game and argue that they should’ve written specifications that included, “Do not spoil results of matches in preview screenshots.”</p>

<p>I’m not here to bash GOM TV. This is a pretty simple mistake that can be easily corrected. Compared to the other VOD hosting site, Twitch TV, GOM TV does an amazing job at not pissing me off, so hats off to them. I sent a tweet to GOM TV; here’s to hoping they clean this crap up!</p>

        Let's Review! Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2013</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/arr-logo.jpg" alt="A Realm Reborn" /> 
  	<p>This past weekend I beat the fourteenth entry in the Final Fantasy series, A Realm Reborn. In recent years, the series has received a lot of flak, and the terrible initial release of Final Fantasy XIV only validated these claims. Yet, in their moment of darkness, it seems Square Enix assembled a team of developers who knew exactly what the Final Fantasy series needed. These developers pulled a Phoenix Down out of their bag and threw it on this game. What came back to life was a truly magical gaming experience.</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-10/scions.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Join the club. Save the world.</b></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Story -</strong> Some of you might be wondering, “How do you beat an MMORPG?” Like other games in the Final Fantasy games, story and character development play integral roles in this game. From level 1 to 50, there was a string of required story quests. The struggle against the supernatural primals and the evil Garlean empire was in the end pretty vanilla with a single, somewhat uninspiring twist along the way. While the story wasn’t as enthralling as the non-MMORPG entries in the series, the story did serve its purpose: it motivated me to continue playing. There are also several characters that you will journey with who enhance what would’ve otherwise been an average plot line. In short, the story didn’t make me shed nerd tears, but at times it did make me pretty pumped to kick some Garlean ass as we journeyed forward.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeons -</strong> Required story missions also included dungeons and trials against tough bosses. I was initially a little worried about this because of my previous experience with dungeons in World of WarCraft. I avoided dungeons because it wasn’t required to progress in the game, and when I did try, I would be in a pick-up group that never seemed able to clear them.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-10/ifrit.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Ifrit's here, but he's not your friendly summon this time around.</b></p>
</div>

<p>At level 15, you are presented with your first instance dungeon. You are put into a group with three other people, and you face off against tough enemies and powerful bosses. By the time you’re level 20, you will have cleared three dungeons and a trial, which is like a dungeon but consists of only a single fight against an extremely powerful enemy. The dungeon content was difficult, but if everyone did their job and knew the attacks their enemies used, it was a pretty straightforward affair. Later on, the difficulty ramps up; dungeons get much more difficult and trials will feature superbosses that massacre you until you are able to figure out a winning strategy and coordinate your team to execute on that plan.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-10-10/stone-vigil.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Stone Vigil &mdash; the first dungeon that was truly challenging.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The instance dungeons and trials are where I felt this game really shined. Even though MMORPGs compose a small part of the Final Fantasy entries, this game made the entire Final Fantasy experience seem more authentic. Instead of being in charge of a party and calling all the shots, you are put into a team with other adventurers, and put up against grueling challenges requiring coordination and teamwork. It was challenging, but it felt great to complete that dungeon, or beat that tough boss after several wipes. In the beginning, I dreaded the dungeons. By the end, I was RELISHING EVERY MINUTE.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Music -</strong> The music in this game deserves a shout out as I was highly impressed (read: moved to nerd tears) by several tracks. The dungeons and trials against the primals and Garleans were already epic in difficulty; they were only enhanced by the game’s sick soundtrack. I honestly lost count of how many times I saw “dat music” in the party chat. Above is Fallen Angel, the track played during the grueling battle against the third primal: Garuda. Below is Steel Reason, the track played during the penultimate dungeon.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Endgame Content -</b> When I first decided to play FF XIV, I promised myself I would stop playing once I hit the endgame. Once I hit the level cap and completed the final story dungeon, I happily put the game down. If I were to continue to play, there would be plenty of things to do:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Level up the 8 crafting or 3 gathering classes</strong> - I really enjoyed crafting. I ended up getting a Goldsmith to level 50 before any other class. I made a bunch of nice equipment (read: friendship bracelets) for myself and my friends, and sold the rest on the marketplace. I also did a bit of gathering which was more of a grind, but could be done as a background task while watching Netflix or something. Having higher level crafting and gathering classes makes you more self-sufficient and also nets you a bunch of gold, which will be useful for those excited for the upcoming housing content patch.</li>
  <li><strong>Level up other classes</strong> - With 5 classes focused on physical combat and 3 specializing in magic, there are plenty of opportunities to check out and level up other classes. This has more benefits than satisfying your curiosity, as certain classes learn abilities that can be shared between different classes. Also, switching from one type of role to another (e.g. switching from a healer to a damage-dealing class) can give you a chance to run dungeons from a different perspective, and gives you flexibility when helping friends out.</li>
  <li><strong>Get endgame gear, do endgame dungeons and trials</strong> - The “real” endgame consists of grinding dungeons to get better gear to take on harder dungeons and Hard Mode Primals. The toughest of these dungeons, The Binding Coil of Bahamut, consists of 5 separate “turns” (i.e. mini dungeons) requiring extreme coordination for the entire 8-person party. As of this writing, no one in the world has bested the 5th turn yet! Members of my guild have been grinding away at the endgame content and seem to be enjoying the challenge (and the rewards).</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, there are plenty of ways I could sink hundreds more hours into Final Fantasy XIV, truuuust me – but for now I’ll just be a “casual player” and wait for the promised quarterly content patches before diving back into Eorzea.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Your reward for completing the story!</b></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts -</strong> Play this game if you’re a Final Fantasy fan, a fan of MMORPGs, or want an introduction to the MMORPG genre. I am no MMORPG afficionado, but my friends who are say this game is pretty approachable. The game is addicting, challenging, packed with content, and a pleasure to play. There are some quality-of-life issues with the game, but Square Enix seems to be responsive to community feedback. If you’re a Final Fantasy fan on the edge, consider that you get to ride and battle on a Magitek Chocobo mount in the final dungeon! And once you beat the game, you get to use that mount wherever you want – awesome sauce! If you do check this game out, create your character on the Faerie server and shoot me a message so we can play together!</p>

  	<p>It's time to keep Kickstarter honest. Founded in 2009, Kickstarter is a crowd-funding platform for people with great ideas who need a little capital to make them happen. If you see a project you like, you pledge a certain amount and based on that amount you are promised a reward if the project succeeds. <b>But there's a catch.</b></p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p><strong>A project can fail</strong>; a game developer could misestimate costs and run out of money halfway through development or deals with a manufacturer can fall through. In September 2012, a Kickstarter blog post explained that funding projects on Kickstarter is not like shopping at a store.<sup>2</sup> There is always risk, there are always challenges, and people should be aware of that. I’m a Kickstarter junky, so let’s see how well the projects I’ve backed have done so far.</p>

<p>I’ve backed <strong>43 projects</strong> on Kickstarter. Of these, <strong>37 have been successfully funded</strong>. So far, <strong>14 have delivered</strong> the promised rewards. Generally, most people were <strong>unable to meet their estimated delivery date</strong>. One project delivered about a month ahead of time, and another delivered right on time, but the other 12 ranged from being a few weeks late to a year late.<sup>3</sup> Again, Kickstarter is not a store and estimated delivery dates are just that – estimates, and really bad ones at that!</p>

<p>That leaves me <strong>waiting on 24 projects</strong>. Of these, 9 are still in development, but if history is any indicator, most of them will be late. So what about the other 15? They range from being 3 months late to over 19 months late.<sup>4</sup> In this case, what should be considered acceptable and unacceptable? I looked at when each project last posted an update. Updates are emailed to all backers to give them more insight into a project’s status. I’ll be lenient: if a project creator has given us an update within the last 6 months, they’re in the clear. If they have not, well, come on – stuff happens, but updating your funders once every half-year isn’t too much to ask, is it?</p>

<p>Of the 15 late projects, 4 haven’t posted one single update within the past six months. Let’s take a look at each one.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/548200252/help-support-beekeeping-bees-have-a-lot-to-teach-u">Help Support Beekeeping</a></strong> (12 months late, <strong>last updated 7 months ago</strong>) - Look Sheryl, I know from your last update 7 months ago that you need to drive your dad to dialysis three times a week and now you need to get that knee replacement surgery you’ve been putting off. I’m sorry, but you said yourself that “problems are no excuse for taking so long to get everyone’s rewards out to them.” It’s been 7 months, Sheryl. I hope your dad is doing well. I hope your knee is okay. And I hope you are able to tell me when I’m going to get my honey.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1657688528/mars-daedalus-two-a-new-realistic-sci-fi-graphic-n">Mars: Daedalus Two – A Sci-Fi Graphic Novel</a></strong> (7 months late, <strong>last updated 7 months ago</strong>) - The last time I heard from Jeffrey Morris, he sent out a preview of the comic he’s working on. He told us his “company has taken some huge strides” since receiving funding and are developing “seventeen additional sci-fi comic book titles.” You know what Jeffrey? I don’t think you can make seventeen comics if you can’t make ONE FREAKING COMIC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd">ANIMUSIC 3</a></strong> (10 months late, <strong>last updated 7 months ago</strong>) - This one is too funny. In the last update from ANIMUSIC, Wayne says, “I felt bad about not getting the CD done on schedule” and “I felt bad about wasting useless mental energy on feeling bad.” You know what, Wayne? You should feel bad and THEN SOME. You raised over $200,000 for your project and not only are you 10 months late, you don’t have an ounce of freaking DECENCY to tell the 3,284 backers how the project is going.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751892223/the-sons-of-starcraft?ref=live">The Sons of StarCraft</a></strong> (12 months late, <strong>last updated 12 months ago</strong>) - Jeffrey Alejos raised over $42,000 to film a documentary on the two preeminent StarCraft casters: Tasteless and Artosis. Tasteless and Artosis even plugged this project multiple times during their casts. A year ago, we got a trailer and a claim that “the film is scheduled to be released in Spring 2013.” With Fall 2013 around the corner, still no updates from Alejos. Just give me my documentary already!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One quick update would have kept these projects off this list. For Christ’s sake, a guy – Edward – with brain cancer posted an update apologizing for his video game project being late.<sup>5</sup> His health has been on a roller-coaster ride, yet Edward, who is going through pain I can’t even imagine, still has the common courtesy to update his supporters. You can do it, too. <strong>Kickstarter is not a store, but it’s also not a charity drive.</strong> You tell us your ideas, we give you support, you do your thing, and we reap some reward – like video games, cool wallets, yummy burger sauce, or at the VERY least, good feels – for helping you. What you don’t do is take people’s money and disappear.</p>

</div>

<p>So, is Kickstarter risky? My experience suggests that a few people may just take your money and run, or something akin to what the 4 projects above have done. But generally, most people seem to be making steady progress, and most will take longer than planned.</p>

<p>How does Kickstarter help hold project creators accountable? Not well. All the data I used to write this post was compiled<sup>6</sup> by myself since Kickstarter does not provide any tools to track progress on backed projects. I would suspect, though, based on my own experience with projects, that if Kickstarter made this data readily available, the numbers would not look good. In a glance, backers would feel like they’re losing money, and that is never good for business. So instead, they just write blog posts telling potential backers that there is always risk – covering their own butts, but helping me none.  <strong>As always on the interwebs, proceed with caution.</strong></p>
