        Lightning Returns - Demo Review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2014</span>

    <p>I’ll come right out and say it – I’m <strong>not</strong> one of those people who looked at Final Fantasy XIII and saw the series coming to a cataclysmic end. Yes, the linearity of the game sucked. Yes, the story was all over the place – to say the least. But the paradigm shift battle system was awesome and very progressive step forward for JRPG battling. And Final Fantasy XIII-2 was actually pretty good – addressing a lot of the issues of its troubled predecessor. The story, featuring everyone’s favorite plot device – time travel – was decent, yet suffered from that JRPG trope of being “complicated to be complicated.” The ending of XIII-2 was an extremely bold one where the villain, Caius, succeeds and the protagonist, Serah, dies. Square Enix wouldn’t just let the bad guy win, hence the sequel to the sequel – <strong>Final Fantasy XIII: Lightning Returns</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-02-02/xiii-3.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>
</div>

<p>Contrary to popular belief on the internets, a sequel to a Final Fantasy game does not automatically make it worthless. Given how good the Bravely Default demo was and how I’m not a member of the “FF13 sucks” hive-mind, I decided to give the demo for the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII: Lightning Returns a go. Let’s see how it went!</p>

<!--break-->

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The demo opens with video featuring a staff roll. Yet, something’s <strong>already</strong> off. This doesn’t look like your typical Final Fantasy highlight reel. It looks like an actual scene from the game because characters are talking to each other, but you don’t know what they’re saying because there is no vocal track and there are no subtitles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I click “Playable Demo” - Let’s do it! Oh wait! I’m being bombarded with a ton of pop-ups about “Otherworld” features. Otherworld lets players share screenshots and sell items to other players. I don’t really care about these features, especially for a demo, so I quickly agree to all the end-user agreements that subsequently pop up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving on, things take a turn for the worst. I have to watch the <strong>SAME</strong> video I just watched, except this time, instead of a staff roll, I get to hear what the characters were saying to each other. I know I’m playing a JRPG, but seriously, what a huge waste of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demo then introduces the battle system. Lightning battles alone in this game, but can switch between different outfits to change up her abilities. You can switch between 3 outfits in battle. Each outfit has its own ATB gauge that depletes when abilities are used. The ATB gauge for outfits not being used recharges while they are not equipped.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After some tutorial battles, you get to run around and chase a person-of-interest. Nothing new and wonderful here, but you get to jump over obstacles, climb up ladders, and slide down poles. When I first saw this game, I thought they were trying to make an Assassin’s Creed clone. I’m glad that theory was way off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After some exploring, you face off against a boss. My fear with the one-woman-army battle system was confirmed in this battle: the <strong>entire battle was such a drag</strong>. A helpful pop-up tells us we should stagger the boss to greatly increase damage by targeting its weakness, Thunder, using the Black Mage outfit. So I spammed Thunder until the Black Mage’s ATB gauge was drained, then switched into the other two outfits and just did plain old attacks until the Black Mage’s ATB gauge recharged. The battle took way too long. In the previous two Final Fantasy XIII games, I would just switch my party into a paradigm that could nuke the boss’ weakness to quickly make short work of it. Even when I was targeting the boss’ weakness, it still felt like I was chipping away fruitlessly. Longer battles doesn’t necessarily mean I’m being challenged; this was just tedious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the boss fight, a pop-up tells us we have until 6:00 AM to play the demo. In Lightning Returns, the world is ending in 13 days. Each in-game day lasts about 2-3 hours in “real-life time.” It’s 3:22 AM so I have about a half hour left to play. I continue through the area and then reach a door where the demo ends <strong>without any warning</strong>! That’s it. No confirmation that I really am done. No pop-up asking me if I want to end the demo prematurely. Nothing. A cutscene and then I’m thrown back to the main menu.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Get it together Square Enix, because this demo was beyond disappointing. Lightning Returns might actually be a decent game, but this demo did a terrible job showing off the game in the best possible light. For some weird reason, Square Enix decided to release Bravely Default on February 7th and Lightning Returns on February 11th. I’ll be picking up Bravely Default on release day, especially given my terrible experience with the Lightning Returns demo. While I’ll likely eventually check out Lightning Returns, I am in no rush to pick up the game.</p>

        The Chrono Trigger Symphony is Complete
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>Blake Robinson is <em>THE</em> hero video game nerds dream about. This man is literally a one-man army with a virtual orchestra at his fingertips, and he’s put that power to great use. Chrono Trigger is on many people’s list of all-time favorite video games, and the memorable soundtrack (composed by Yasunori Mitsuda) is a pillar of the game’s greatness. Even today, the MIDI-based soundtrack inspires nostalgia and brings even the most powerful nerds to tears. But Blake Robinson would not let Mitsuda’s work be shackled by the 16 channels of MIDI, so he took the original soundtrack, scored it for an orchestra, and let his virtual orchestra play it. Yesterday, he released the third (and final) part of The Chrono Trigger Symphony. Hit the play button below to listen to Yearnings of the Wind and keep reading.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUclDZHax0w?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This isn’t a re-imagining or remix of the original soundtrack. The original soundtrack was on three CDs, and The Chrono Trigger Symphony spans three volumes, EXACTLY matching the track-list of the original. I’m no music buff, but Robinson and his virtual orchestra, from start to finish, do a pretty amazing job “musically upscaling” the original soundtrack. Your favorite gems will move you even more, and tracks that previously might’ve not been in your favorites are now competing for those top spots. Never before has being torn felt so freaking good. If you love Chrono Trigger, I can guarantee listening to The Chrono Trigger Symphony will fill you with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade">saudades</a> and make you want to dust off your SNES.</p>

        Back It Up
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>World Backup Day is two months away, but important messages can’t wait: <strong>back it up right now.</strong> Imagine this: your computer disappears. How screwed are you? Now imagine this: in addition to your computer disappearing, every hard drive in your home also disappears. Are you ready for DATA DOOMSDAY? The migration to digital has become ubiquitous: everything is going digital. It’s easy to take for granted that a malfunctioning disk can take away with it irreplaceable photos, videos, and documents. Theft sucks. And hard drive recovery services might as well be theft because they cost so much. Plus, your chances of recovering anything are slim to none. THAT being said, it’s not hard to play it safe with your digital data: <strong>just back it up RIGHT NOW.</strong></p>

<!--break-->

<p>My backup solution consists of <strong>local backups</strong>, <strong>offsite backups</strong>, and <strong>cloud backups</strong>. Yours should too.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-24/sp.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>A solid investment.</b></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Local backups</strong> refer to backups to a drive I have at home. On my Mac, I just plug in a drive and Time Machine handles backing up my entire system. If my computer ever exploded, I could plug the drive into another computer and restore EVERYTHING onto that new machine within an hour. This is especially useful because I don’t want to set up my apps and development environment all over again. Local backups are fast, but somewhat annoying - they require me to plug in a drive and wait while the backup completes. That said, I try to update my local backup every weekend; I configured Google Calendar to remind me every Sunday to back up. If I go 10 days without doing a Time Machine backup, my computer even starts nagging me. Hard drives are cheap (definitely cheaper than hard drive recovery services); I’m a big fan of Silicon Power’s 1 TB shock-proof portable hard drive which costs $70.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-24/timemachine.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Back it up, now!</b></p>
</div>

<p>When I’m visiting my family in New Jersey, I do an <strong>offsite backup</strong> to a drive I have there. If something were to happen to both my computer and my local backup in California, I would <em>only lose a few months of my digital life</em>. That doesn’t sound particularly good, but it’d be a lot worse to lose everything! When my sister visits California, she backs up to one of my local backup drives. Anyone and everyone you care about – Help them stay backed up!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-24/backup-america.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Back ups from sea to shining sea.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Local backups and offsite backups are great, but since you’re unlikely to do them every 5 minutes, drift can occur. That’s where <strong>cloud backups</strong> come in. Backing up to the cloud is slow, but is a great complement to local and offsite backups.  Your first backup to the cloud will likely take weeks, but subsequent (incremental) backups will be quick. The best thing about cloud backups is that they are automatic and frequent. They should still be considered a last line of defense because restoring from the cloud is painfully slow. That said, I’d rather wait months to get all my data back then have it be lost forever.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-24/crashplan-logo.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Spoiler alert - CrashPlan is the best cloud backup service.</b></p>
</div>

<p>There are plenty of cloud backup services out there. I’ve tried a bunch of them, but my favorite is <em>CrashPlan</em>. For <em>under nine bucks a month</em>, I can back up <em>unlimited data from 10 computers</em>. If you’ve got a home server, you can even use that as “the cloud” and pay nothing to use CrashPlan. If family or friends have reservations about backing up their data to “the cloud” or your server, they can take comfort in the 448-bit key that encrypts their data. Only with that key can their data be accessed, so make sure they keep it in a safe place! If you need to restore from the cloud quickly, you can even pay CrashPlan a handsome amount ($164.99) to have them ship your backup to you on a hard drive. Honestly, I can’t recommend them enough. I’m slowly getting my entire family and friends set to back up to my home server. Again, good friends keep their friends backed up!</p>

<p>Now you know – so run, don’t walk! <strong>Go back it up right now</strong>.</p>

        Cooking With My Grandma - Rabanadas
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>Your grandma is usually the best cook you know. My grandma, at least, is definitely the best cook I know. Funnily enough, if we’re friends, my grandma is also likely to be <em>your</em> favorite cook. This past holiday season, I shadowed my grandma while she prepared a traditional Portuguese holiday dessert: rabanadas. I always tell my non-Portuguese friends that it’s similar to French Toast.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/final.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Rabanadas a.k.a. Portuguese French Toast</b></p>
</div>

<p>My grandma doesn’t use recipes – or even measuring utensils. Somehow, the result is always consistently great. Shadowing her, I wasn’t looking to extract an exact recipe out of her, but just to get the basic steps and to get useful tips. Here’s my go at trying to capture some of her cooking magic.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>To put what’s coming up in context, the general steps to making rabanadas is: cutting bread, soaking it in milk, soaking it in eggs, and finally frying the bread. I observed my grandma whip up four dozen.</p>

<h1 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h1>
<p>The ingredients are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Long Italian loaves – You’ll want to buy the loaves two to three days before you cook so that the loaves harden up a bit. If you use fresh loaves, the bread will begin to fall apart as you cook the rabanadas.</li>
  <li>Milk – My grandma recommends 2% reduced fat milk.</li>
  <li>Two whole cinnamon sticks</li>
  <li>Six spoonfuls of sugar</li>
  <li>Some honey</li>
  <li>One lemon</li>
  <li>Nine eggs</li>
  <li>Vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Other useful things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cutting board and knife to cut the bread</li>
  <li>Large pan to prepare the milk</li>
  <li>Medium-sized pan for the eggs</li>
  <li>Strainer and another pan that fits the strainer</li>
  <li>Frying pan</li>
  <li>Aluminum tray with cardboard paper lining</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>

<p>1. <strong>Prepare the milk.</strong> In your large, stove-friendly pot add a generous amount (about one liter) of milk. Take a lemon and skin it; add the skin to the milk. Be careful - don’t add any lemon flesh! The rind and white spongey layer is okay. Then add two whole cinnamon sticks, about 6 spoonfuls of sugar, and some honey (optional). Then warm this up on the stove a bit to help everything dissolve and blend together. If you run out of milk later, you can just add more milk (and sugar) to replenish your supply.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/milk.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p>2. <strong>Whisk the eggs.</strong> You’ll want about 3 eggs for every dozen rabanadas. Put them in a pan and whisk them.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/eggs.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p>3. <strong>Set up the strainer.</strong> Later, you will be dipping the bread in the eggs. When you do that, you’ll want to let some of the excess milk and egg fall off before putting the bread in hot oil. Thus, why you need a strainer. Put your strainer in a pot, and you can recycle the liquid that falls out and put it back in the whisked eggs pan.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/strainer.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p>4. <strong>Add oil to the frying pan.</strong> My grandma puts about 1 cm of oil in a frying pan. At first, the stove was set to 7/10 but as the oil got hotter, she brought it down to 5/10. After each dozen rabanadas you make, my grandma recommends changing the oil. As you cook the bread, small pieces will fall off, and in the hot oil, those pieces will burn up. You don’t want pieces of burnt bread on the finished product!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/oil.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Fresh oil (left) and oil after frying some bread (right).</b></p>
</div>

<p>5. <strong>Prepare your “landing zone.”</strong> A proper “landing zone” has something that will soak up the oil, but not fall apart. My grandma uses an aluminum tray with the paper from the paper bag the loaves come in. This is likely the only recorded instance of my grandma “recycling.” Don’t use paper towels because my grandma said so.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/landing.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p>6. <strong>Cut the bread.</strong> My grandma just says “cut the bread,” but she actually made every piece of bread consistently 1.5 inches wide.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/cutting.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p>Now you’re ready to go!</p>

<h1 id="steps-to-rabanadas">4 steps to rabanadas</h1>

<p>Once you’ve done all the prep work, set up everything like the picture below. You’ll work your way from left to right now.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/5_steps.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Start on the left and work over to the right.</b></p>
</div>

<p>1. <strong>Into the milk.</strong> First, put your slices of bread into the pan of milk. You don’t want to let the bread soak for too long in the milk because it will begin to fall apart, but you do want milk to get thoroughly absorbed into the bread. For reference, my grandma would let the bread soak in the milk between 90 and 120 seconds. Make sure you get all sides of the bread soaked; if you have only a little bit of milk or the bread is floating be sure every side gets some time in the milk.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/in_milk.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p>2. <strong>And then into the eggs.</strong> Moving on, you’ll put the bread into the pan with the whisked eggs. This part shouldn’t take too long; my grandma didn’t leave the bread in there for longer than half a minute, ever. Just get some egg on there, and move on.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Drain excess liquid.</strong> Before putting the bread into the frying pan my grandma puts the bread in a strainer for a minute or so. This lets any excess liquid drain, which cuts down on the pain you’ll experience if hot liquid starts popping out from the frying pan! If you’re running low on eggs, just use the liquid that drains out in this step to refill your egg pan.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/in_strainer.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p>4. <strong>Fry the bread.</strong> The general steps are 1) fry one side until golden, 2) flip the bread, and 3) fry the other side until golden, before taking it out. Grandma says you should avoid flipping it more than one time because you will absorb more oil, so feel free to lift the bread up a little bit to double-check before you flip it over. It takes about 2 to 3 minutes of frying on each side to hit the sweet spot, although the time will vary depending on how hot your oil is. Once both sides are golden, carefully remove the bread (grandma uses a barbecue fork) and place them in your “landing zone.”</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/in_pan.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Bread just placed in the pan (left) and bread fried the proper amount (right).</b></p>
</div>

<p>Rinse and repeat until you’re out of bread and you’re done!</p>

<h1 id="and-were-done">And we’re done!</h1>

<p>It doesn’t seem so hard, but I know the minute I try to do it myself, I’ll totally screw it up. That said, rabanadas seem like a good first excursion into attempting to cook Portuguese dishes! Bom apetite!</p>

    <p>It’s a fact of life: your Android activities aren’t always going to be the center of attention. They can be backgrounded either because your entire app is backgrounded or because another activity of your app is pushed onto the activity stack. Even sadder, while backgrounded, your activity (and its state) can be entirely destroyed. If you don’t handle this case, the eventual return of your activity will be less-than-ideal. Fortunately, it’s not that hard to handle this problem.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>1. <strong>Use Android Annotations.</strong> Besides being used in the forthcoming examples, Android Annotations helps you write simpler code. Everyone loves simpler code. <a href="http://androidannotations.org/">Get it now!</a></p>

<p>2. <strong>Develop and test with “Don’t keep activities” option turned on.</strong> Under normal circumstances, activities can be destroyed when you background them in low-memory situations. Enabling this option (in Settings ~&gt; Developer Options) will force a pathological low-memory environment and activities will be destroyed as soon as you leave them. Don’t be lazy. Turn on this option, and make sure your activities can handle getting sent to the grave and getting revived.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Use static methods to generate intents for your activities.</strong> Using helper methods to generate ready-to-go intents forces you to pass data you’ll need for your activity to function properly. The data you pass in to these methods is data you will likely be concerned about when activities start getting destroyed and recreated. This is also useful if you need to later pass additional data to your activity. Add any new parameters, hit compile, and fix all the errors!</p>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">intent</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>4. <strong>Figure out what to save when an activity is destroyed and @InstanceState it.</strong> Both of these are easy. First, any of the parameters you pass to your intent-generating methods you likely want to save. You’d used them to create the activity, so you’ll want them again when you recreate the activity. For these values, create fields and annotate them with @InstanceState. If your activity is destroyed, the code generated by Android Annotations will automagically save these fields to the bundle. If you’ve got complex objects, this will work if they implement the Parcelable interface.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="c1">// fields annotated with @InstanceState cannot be private</span>
<span class="nd">@InstanceState</span> <span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">mAccountId</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>5. <strong>In onCreate, @InstanceState will be handled for you so just check for a null savedInstanceState and parse the data out yourself.</strong> If you’ve set everything else up, the only thing left to do is figure out what state you’re in in your onCreate method. If the activity is getting created for the first time, the Bundle passed in will be null and you’ll want to parse out all that data you stashed into your Intent. Otherwise, you’re getting recreated and the onCreate super method will handle restoring all annotated fields (courtesy of Android Annotations).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nd">@Override</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onCreate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Bundle</span> <span class="n">savedInstanceState</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<p><strong>That’s it!</strong> You can test the resilience of your activities by backgrounding your application or going to another activity and then returning back to that activity. In the hands of your customers, expect your app to be backgrounded for long periods of time and running on devices where a plethora of other apps are running. Eventually, an activity is going to pay the price and get sent to the grave to free up resources. Will your app’s return to life be elegant and seamless, or a disaster?</p>
