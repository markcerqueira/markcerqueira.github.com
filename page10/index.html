        Computer Security Basics
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2015</span>

    <p>In our rapidly technologizing world, staying secure means adapting to novel threats. Staying safe isn’t difficult. A little effort here and there will keep you out of a lot of trouble. Here are some basic computer security tips.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Passwords</strong> - Most people are terrible about passwords: using just a single password for everything. This is bad. When you hear about a website getting hacked, and passwords getting leaked your first thought should not be, “Crap! What other sites was I using that password on?” It should be, “Oh… I guess I need to update my password on that one site.” You need unique passwords for everything. Don’t share passwords unless you are okay with someone getting into that service. The unique password lifestyle isn’t as hard as it sounds. There are plenty of password managers that make staying secure easy. I like <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Two-factor authentication</strong> - Two-factor means you need two things to log onto a particular service. You are probably already familiar with one-factor authentication when a service just asks you for your password. Two-factor requires another form of verification. Usually this is a code sent via SMS to your phone or a code generated on your phone with an app like Google Authenticator. For any critical services (anything involving access to your email or money) it’s important to set up two-factor authentication. This makes accessing your account more difficult for adversaries and isn’t as big an inconvenience as some people make it out to be. For most services, you are allowed to flag a device as personal. Once flagged, it won’t ask for a code again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Back up your data</strong> - Devices break, devices get stolen, and sometimes you accidentally delete important files. Keeping your data safe is important and it’s something that’s often overlooked because you don’t really see the value of your data until it’s long gone. The cost of backing up your data is chump change compared to the cost of attempting to recover data from a bad hard drive or the mental anguish suffered if a thief makes off with your computer. I wrote a whole post about backing up, aptly named <a href="http://mark.gg/2014/01/24/back-it-up/">Back It Up</a>. For the impatient: just get <a href="https://www.code42.com/crashplan/">CrashPlan</a> and let it automagically back everything up for you to the cloud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep your computer up-to-date</strong> - Is your computer nagging you to install some updates? Go ahead and let it do it’s thing, especially if they mention security in them. Keeping your computer updated leaves you less vulnerable to all the bad stuff out there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enable Click-to-Play in your browser</strong> - Most web browsers load all content when you visit a page. A page can include content that requires a plug-in like Flash or Silverlight to run. If these plug-ins have some vulnerability, malware can silently target those vulnerabilities. If you see an update for Java, Adobe Reader, Quicktime, Silverlight or Flash install them ASAP! This <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser/">How to Geek article</a> explains how to set up click-to-play on the more popular web browsers.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is certainly not an exhaustive list, but it’s a decent start to protecting yourself. Did I get something totally wrong or something super important is missing here? <a href="https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira">Send me a tweet!</a> Cheers!</p>

    <p>I previously wrote about the <a href="http://mark.gg/2014/11/18/finish-the-flow/">Instagram “report user” user experience</a>, which I felt left users hanging at the end. I noticed the problematic part of the flow has recently been changed! But I’m unsure how I feel about the changes. Here’s the new “report user” flow:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-09-06/donedone3.gif" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>DONE and DONE!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Check out that last frame where you are thanked for reporting the offending user. Before, if you reported someone Instagram made you hit “Cancel” to dismiss the confirmation but now it gives you <strong>TWO</strong> “DONE” buttons. This new UX paradigm which I dub <strong>Better Safe Than Sorry UX - let’s just put the button twice to ensure users get it</strong> is pretty innovative, certainly strange, and questionably provides a good user experience.</p>

        Tips for Aspiring Programmers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2015</span>

    <p>Every so often I have friends ask me to talk to the someone who is interested in computers and programming. I’m always eager to run my mouth so I, naturally, always jump on the opportunity. But after telling the same story multiple times I figured it’d be more efficient to just write down my definitive <strong>TIPS FOR ASPIRING PROGRAMMERS</strong> here and just share this instead.</p>

<p><strong>It’s never too late to start.</strong> You don’t need to decide to become a programmer early in life. A lot of people don’t even study computer science in college and just pick up programming on their own. Some people don’t even go to college, although I highly recommend college as it was a great academic and personal learning experience. I have worked with many talented people who have taken many different paths to becoming strong programmers.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="margin-top: 20px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-08-04/pl.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>So many programming languages to choose from!</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Don’t get hung up on picking your first language.</strong> Lots of people are intimidated by how expansive the programming world is. You can program for micro-chips, phones, computers, servers, and even networks composed of many computers. The number of programming languages out there is also ridiculous. But don’t get bogged down by all the options you have. Just pick a language and go with it. The first language I learned was Java and I think it’s still a decent first language to learn.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>If you want to learn about programming and computer music, check out this course<br />on Kadenze taught by some of my (very, very) smart friends!</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>There are lots of free, online resources to get you started.</strong> But where do you start? Fortunately there are tons of great and free resources available online. With the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) available on sites like <a href="https://www.coursera.com">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.kadenze.com">Kadenze</a>, you can sit in (i.e. watch videos) of real college courses from the comfort of your home. Watch the videos, do the homework assignments, and you’ll be pumping out code in no time. If you require more structure see if there is a local college that offers introductory programming courses.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Build something, even if it’s small and inconsequential.</strong> Once you’re comfortable with a programming language, try building something! It doesn’t need to change the world. Just pick a problem and solve it. Out of ideas and into space? I really enjoyed working on <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos126/assignments/nbody.html">N-body Simulations</a> and the <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos126/assignments/tsp.html">Traveling Salesman Problem</a> during my first college computer science course.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Git + GitHub = A match made in heaven.</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Learn to use version control early.</strong> Version control lets you do work and “commit” progress. Committing basically is like a save point for your work; if you do something terrible after making a commit, you can easily see what you did since that commit and undo it if necessary. It also makes working with multiple people on a project (the norm in most projects) much easier. I only started using version control when I started working, but wish I had done so from the get-go. It lets you do work and get to a good point, save that point, and continue working. It reinforces good behavior in programming: build out things incrementally and make sure they work before moving on. Like programming languages there are many version control systems. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> are pretty popular right now; git is the system used to version control your code and GitHub is where you can remotely host your code and share it with others.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Xcode sucks, but it'll only run on a Mac!</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>If you’re getting a computer to program, just get a Mac.</strong> This is definitely just my opinion because I know a lot of people are very sensitive over this issue. I grew up on Windows and switched over to Macs in college. I’ve used a few flavors of Linux in college. When it comes to finding the sweet spot between user-friendliness, usability, and “ease of jumping into programming” Macs leave Windows and Linux in the dust. Also, if you’re planning on programming for iOS or Macs, you’ll definitely need a Mac. For what it’s worth, the vast, vast, vast majority of engineers I’ve met in the Bay Area use Macs.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>This blog is powered by Jekyll which is a program itself!</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Start a blog and just write!</strong>  I think writing is great for reflection and growth. Maybe you had a lot of trouble figuring out how to do X but searched around and found A, B, C solutions and decided to go with C because of this and that reason. Writing is a great skill to have. I found once you start working as a programmer, you’ll spend most of your time just writing code. That said, being able to effectively put your thoughts in writing will make you a better communicator and engineering is not only about writing code. Another benefit of having a blog is it increases your visibility. If an employer is Googling you (pretty common - I do it for interview candidates just to see what pops up), it’s good to be out there and have a voice. You don’t need to write exclusively about technical stuff. Write about things you care about. I write not only about technical stuff, but also random things that interest me (food, video games, etc). In short, writing will help you more effectively learn and grow as a programmer and put a more human face to you when you are sending your resume around town for jobs.</p>

<p>There you go! It’s a lot, but I hope it helps you get started if you’re interested in programming. If you have any more questions feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira">send me a tweet</a>!</p>

<p>I recently read a post by Chris Beams on <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">How to Write a Git Commit Message</a>. Before I get into it, I want to emphasize that this post isn’t about hating on Chris or his advice; they’re both awesome. ♥</p>

<p>This post is about something I noticed in Chris’ post and something I hear come up way too often in the programming world: how amazing the command-line interface (CLI) is and how everyone should be using it as exclusively as possible because <strong>it’s the best thing ever</strong>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Chris’ post, we are left with some helpful tips to be the best git-people that no one ever was. One tip focuses on the importance of using git on the CLI:</p>

<blockquote>
Learn to love the command line. Leave the IDE behind.<br /><br />

For as many reasons as there are git subcommands, it's wise to embrace the command line. Git is insanely powerful; IDEs are too, but each in different ways. I use an IDE every day (IntelliJ IDEA) and have used others extensively (Eclipse), but I have never seen IDE integration for git that could begin to match the ease and power of the command line (once you know it).<br /><br />

Certain git-related IDE functions are invaluable, like calling git rm when you delete a file, and doing the right stuff with git when you rename one. Where everything falls apart is when you start trying to commit, merge, rebase, or do sophisticated history analysis through the IDE.<br /><br />

When it comes to wielding the full power of git, it's command-line all the way.
</blockquote>

<p>You know what I think? <strong>SCREW COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE ELITISM</strong>.</p>

<p>Look, I use git on both the command-line and with my preferred git GUI of choice: <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/">Tower</a>. I like to do certain things in Tower (review commits, stage individual files, write commit messages) and I like to do other things on the CLI (interactive rebases, fetches, resolving merge conflicts, pushes). It works well for me. I am comfortable and capable with my workflow, and I’m pretty fast at getting from point A to point B in the git world, even though I am not going “command-line all the way.”</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-07-28/harmony.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>We can all live in HARMONY!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>For anyone getting started with git I always tell them about my own workflow. They’ll learn about how you can use both GUIs and CLI, which is more than enough to get them going. If they have any questions down the road, I’ll also already be familiar with their setup. :) I don’t feel like I’m setting them up for failure by encouraging using a GUI but rather just showing them that there are many ways to get git done. Becoming comfortable and good at anything is a process and it should be treated as such.</p>

<p>I think this whole “CLI or bust” attitude is really silly. Writing a blog post about it <del>is definitely</del> may be even sillier…</p>

<p>P.S. I also can’t stand bad commit messages so if you haven’t already, go read <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">Chris’ post</a> now!</p>

        Useful Utilities - Paste Typer

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jul 2015</span>

    <p>Sometimes you just want to paste. And <strong>sometimes you can’t paste</strong>. Right-clicks are ignored. Command/Control + V is also ignored. Sadness ensues.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, here are some of those annoying times you can’t just paste:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entering passwords when creating and opening an encrypted disk image.</li>
  <li>Websites that (stupidly) prevent you from pasting passwords.</li>
  <li>Pasting text copied from outside a Genymotion emulator into the emulator.</li>
  <li>Logging into certain apps like Google Drive on Mac while setting them up.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are plenty of AppleScripts and applets that promise to simulate typing what’s on your clipboard to get around this issue. My favorite is <strong>Paste Typer</strong>. Download it, copy it to Applications folder and then drag it from there into the dock. Put your cursor where you want text pasted, click on the icon on your dock, and boom! The contents of your clipboard are pasted.</p>

<p>I always have a hard time finding a download link for Paste Typer when I want to download it, so <a href="https://mega.nz/#!MAQgHKDK!rGLCFvOyddcSSNcPMZH5dkeqqXdHKoGOP_AXnA2jQ18">here is a link</a> to Paste Typer.</p>

<p>Now enjoy the freedom to never be denied your unalienable right to pasting.</p>
