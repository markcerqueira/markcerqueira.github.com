        Thoughts on Archon Mode
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2014</span>

    <p>This past weekend, Blizzard unveiled the final chapter in the StarCraft 2 trilogy: Legacy of the Void. Naturally, a lot of attention has been paid to the slew of additions and changes to the multiplayer compositions for each race, but one of the cooler announcements was the unveiling of <strong>Archon Mode</strong>. Like two High Templars joining to form a single formidable Archon, in Archon Mode, two players control a single base/army and battle a single foe.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-11-12/archon.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Archon Mode!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Why is this needed? <strong>StarCraft is hard.</strong> It’s really freaking hard. You need to macro to keep your economy healthy. You need to micro to get the most out of every unit in engagements. And if you want to really do well, you need to split your army and micro on multiple fronts. Having a good strategy is key, but mechanics play an even larger role in success. You need to be able to execute a plan. In that respect, <strong>playing StarCraft can be very discouraging.</strong> Every time you find yourself improving, the match-making system matches you up with better and better opponents. Even at the professional level, there are clear cases where improved – beyond the already ridiculously impressive – level of multi-tasking and mechanics would impact the flow of a game.</p>

<p>Archon Mode should alleviate this somewhat and <strong>make the game more approachable</strong>, for all skill levels. It’ll be interesting to see how far Blizzard runs with this. It’d be cool to see a ladder just for Archon Mode, where two people can face off against two other people… or one Korean! While I’m excited to play with all the new units, I’m excited to merge with a friend and become an OP (over-powered) Archon!</p>

<p>Read more about Archon Mode in its <a href="http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/16658015/legacy-of-the-void-archon-mode-11-8-2014">official announcement</a>.</p>

        PayPal and Delusions of Grandeur

    <p><strong>tl;dr - PayPal thinks they’re awesome, but I still think they suck.</strong></p>

<p>It always blows my mind when PayPal acts like a company that’s succeeding at doing everything right. After the recent iCloud hack, where a bunch of celebrities had risqué photos leaked, PayPal decided to throw a punch at Apple.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-22/paypal_ad.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>You would think with an ad like this, PayPal is really at the forefront of protecting their customers. <strong>WRONG</strong>.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>In June, I raged hard when PayPal said they were <a href="/2014/06/04/kicking-the-tires-with-paypal/">“kicking the tires”</a> when it came to integrating Apple’s TouchID API into their iOS app. Raged because they were talking about integrating TouchID when their iOS app didn’t even support two-factor authentication. Months later, <strong>the PayPal iOS app still does not support two-factor authentication</strong> and of course, does not support TouchID either. Upping the ante on how bad they are, the app now instructs you to “download the new app” that supports two-factor authentication. <strong>No such version exists.</strong></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-22/ios_lies.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>It's all a lie!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>When I log onto PayPal on my computer, which supports two-factor authentication, <strong>I’m presented with the two-factor authentication prompt… EVERY SINGLE TIME</strong>. Most services with two-factor authentication let you check a box to “remember this computer.” This drops an auth token on your computer that usually expires in a really, really long time. When you try logging on again, the auth token is used to skip the security code part of authentication. PayPal can’t be troubled with making security more convenient. <strong>Every time you log onto PayPal, you will need to enter a security code.</strong></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-22/security_key.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>An exercise in frustration!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>People say there are trade-offs between security and convenience. But some security does not need to come at the cost of all convenience. “Keep your money safer by turning off two-factor authentication because our iOS app does not support it and it’s really annoying on our website” says <strong>PayPal – a company that truly doesn’t care about your security.</strong></p>

        The NEW iPad Mini 3

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>Today, Apple unveiled new iPads. This included an update to the iPad Mini: the iPad Mini 3. The older iPad Mini 2 got a $100 price cut too. Now, let’s play a game. One year after the iPad Mini 2 was released, what’s new in the iPad Mini 3? Here is a picture compiled from the comparison chart Apple provides on its site.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-16/ipad.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>If you got to the end, and found that (aside from price) the only new thing in the iPad Mini 3 is Touch ID (Fingerprint identity sensor), you’ve won the game! Huzzah! Today felt more like a price-drop announcement for the iPad Mini 2 than the unveiling of a new and awesome iPad Mini 3.</p>

        QR Codes Suck
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>It could always get better, but as things stand right now, QR codes suck. Here’s my most recent <strong>GOD-AWFUL experience with QR codes</strong>. I was at my favorite bubble tea place in the world: ShareTea in San Mateo. While waiting for my drink to be brought down from heaven by angels, I saw a sign posted on the wall.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-06/sharetea.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>I thought to myself, “Aww yeah! I’ll follow you on Instagram.” I pulled out my iPhone, launched the Camera app, pointed it at the QR code, and waited. <strong>Nothing.</strong> I launched Instagram, switched to camera mode, and repeated. <strong>Nothing.</strong></p>

<p>Stuff just isn’t right here!</p>

<!--break-->

<p><strong>The advertisement should include the Instagram username.</strong> Seems pretty negligent to exclude it given how short usernames typically are: in this case shareteasanmateo. But isn’t the whole point of the QR code to eliminate the need for us to type out that username?</p>

<p>The larger issue here is <strong>built-in QR code support sucks.</strong> It sucks on iOS. It sucks on Android. To read QR codes, you need to download an app… And there a ton of them! Seriously, I can google for the “best QR code reader on iOS [or Android],” and there are actually a plethora of relevant hits.</p>

<p>But once I settled for an app, the experience did not really get any better.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 300px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-06/casinotea.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>Scanning the above QR code, I am taken to the ShareTea’s Instagram page in an embedded browser, featuring ads for some Zynga-esque casino game. And that’s it. I can’t hit the follow button because I’m not logged into Instagram in this embedded browser. I still don’t know the username because it’s no where to be found on the webpage – hats off to the Instagram team! I actually need to click on the URL and navigate to the end to see it. Then I need to do that click-hold gesture and drag to select just the username, copy it, open Instagram, paste it and FINALLY, I can follow ShareTea.</p>

<p>What did the QR code get me? <strong>Nothing.</strong> It’s not helpful. It’s not faster. It’s actually very frustrating.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, the OS on my phone should recognize and parse a QR code into a common format (the hardest part here) that can <strong>do more than simply open a webpage</strong>.  In that wonderful future, I would just launch the Camera app, point it at the QR code, the QR code would contain an app identifier (e.g Instagram), and metadata related to the end-goal (e.g. following ShareTea). The Camera app notifies me that the QR code wants to launch Instagram. If I accept, it takes me into the app, and then to the user’s page before finally asking me to follow them.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>One day, those may be tears of happiness...</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Hang in there QR codes! You suck now, but <strong>there is hope for the future</strong>!</p>
