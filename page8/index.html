        Evernote Hackathon Report

    <p><strong>Evernote’s first hackathon is complete!</strong> Evernoters took the week to work on some really awesome projects. My project was pretty simple, but satisfied a critical need: building a system for people to quickly give feedback on their meal. Evernote has catering bring in delicious food for us to enjoy five days a week. When the facilities team tries out new caterers, they want to know what Evernoters think about the meals. This project allowed feedback to easily be given, collected, and reviewed.</p>

</div>

<p>As with most things programming, bootstrapping is always the hugest pain. I settled on building a back-end service in Rails that allows the facilities team to input information on lunches, view information for all lunches on a sweet-looking dashboard, and a voting API for clients to call. Everything is driven from webpages, but we built a simple Android app to wrap the whole thing nicely. My Chief Design Officer, Justin, made everything look delicious.</p>

<p>For having the most honorable project we won <strong>Honorable Mention</strong> at the awards ceremony. There were a ton of amazing projects, including a bunch of awesome additions to the core Evernote product. I’m super excited to see these getting rolled in and released to Evernote customers around the world.</p>

    <p><strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> Skip this post if you haven’t watched Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</p>

<p>The first Star Wars episodes released – 4 through 6 – are collectively referred to as the <strong>original trilogy</strong>. Episodes 1 through 3, which predate the events in the original trilogy, comprise the <strong>prequel trilogy</strong>.</p>

<p>After watching The Force Awakens, I think we are in the midst of the <strong>transition trilogy</strong>. The general theme of the transition trilogy? See old talent out the door as new talented is ushered in. Han kicked the bucket in episode 7. I predict Luke and Leia are in for unfortunate times in the next two episodes.</p>

<p>Transitions… They happen sometimes.</p>

    <p><strong>Happy New Year!</strong> In 2016, I’m making two resolutions: <strong>eat more pizza</strong> and <strong>automate things to make life simpler</strong>. The former will be easy to commit to! I can eat pizza like no other and will continue to devour pizza this year.</p>

<p>The other is a little more difficult to define and execute. But it will have produce value over time. Technology has become great at sucking up everyone’s time. I want to turn that around and <strong>leverage technology to help me do things more easily and give me time back</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s do this, 2016!</p>

        Xenoblade Chronicles X Tips
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>The first time I sat down with Xenoblade Chronicles X, I felt – in the best way possible – totally overwhelmed. Having spent plenty of time with the game now, I’ve learned a lot along the way. The game doesn’t hold your hand very much so as I convince friends to take the dive into Mira, I decided to prepare a spoiler-free list of quick-start tips to help them get started.</p>

<p><strong>Read the manual and watch the Survival Guide video series.</strong> It’s pretty daunting at 142 pages, but the <a href="https://cdn03.nintendo-europe.com/media/downloads/games_8/emanuals/wii_u_6/xenoblade_chronicles_x/ElectronicManual_WiiU_XenobladeChroniclesX_EN.pdf">manual</a> has lots of useful information. I read it piece by piece while I was taking a break from the game. Also very useful are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtbEyrlD8PMV6b2NZsvl5b3pDzr4vQaOP">survival guide videos</a> by Nintendo. Except for the annoyingly (and unnecessarily) sassy narrator, the videos are very useful in getting you started on Mira. If you only want to do the bare minimum I recommend watching the Your New Home, Planetary Defense, and Mining Your Own Business videos.</p>

<p><strong>Turn subtitles on.</strong> This game unfortunately suffers from some questionable sound design decisions. Songs with lyrics play during scenes where characters are conversing and even worse, the audio is terribly balanced which results in characters’ words getting drowned out in the background song. Turn on subtitles and read your way through this flaw.</p>

<p><strong>Early on feel free to explore and plant data probes.</strong> Don’t feel like you need to rush through the story missions. Most story missions require you to explore a certain percentage of Mira so running around and planting data probes early on is <del>required</del> encouraged. Exploring will also open up fast-travel points so you can move around more efficiently later on.</p>

<!--break-->

<p><strong>If you’re aiming for 100% completion, do not fret – there are no missables that count towards completion.</strong> There are some heart-to-heart conversations for one particular character that are missable, but they do not count towards completion. I would avoid looking up which character this is as it may spoil some of the story for you. In short, do your thing without fear of missing out on 100%.</p>

<p><strong>Probes are not lost when you swap them.</strong> For example, if you are swapping a Research Probe on a particular site for a Mining Probe, the Research Probe will be returned to your inventory. You still need to pay a placement fee each time you place a probe so it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. <strong>Revenue also increases on sites with discovered sight-seeing spots.</strong> If a site has a sight-seeing spot in its range you will see something like “Sightseeing Spots Found 0/2” when you click on the data probe site.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t stress about picking your BLADE division</strong> as you can easily change it later. Different actions like collecting items, hunting indigens, and planting data probes will gain you BLADE experience points which will level up your standing – your BLADE level – in organization. Different divisions give more or less points for these actions depending on what that division’s main goal is. For example, Curators who are tasked with collecting materials get more points for collecting items compared to Pathfinders who are charged with discovering locations and planting data probes. You can read more about the different divisions spoiler-free on the <a href="http://xenoblade.wikia.com/wiki/Division">Xenoblade Wiki</a>. I recommend going with the Curators because you’ll always be collecting a ton of items while roaming Mira.</p>

<p><strong>When your BLADE level increases, talk to Eleonora at the BLADE Concourse</strong> in the Administrative District – next to where you get missions – to level up your field skills. There are three field skills: Mechanical, Archaeological, and Biological. Planting data probes is dependent on your Mechanical level so I recommend leveling that up to level 4 first and then leveling up the other two skills. Note that opening a treasure depends on the field skill corresponding to the type of treasure so you won’t be able to open Archaeological or Biological treasures over level 1, but that’s okay; just come back for them later!</p>

<p><strong>The Shadowrunner arte can give you stealth outside of battle.</strong> This is extremely helpful if you’re trying to open a treasure or plant a data probe guarded by a powerful enemy. The Commando class learns this arte, but you don’t need to go this class route to have access to it as Elma learns it. Read more about this on this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/3wmyqw/psa_the_art_shadowrunner_from_the_commando_class/">reddit post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Allocated Battle Points (BP) cannot be reset but you can keep farming more.</strong> BP is used to upgrade artes and skills to make them more powerful. As you gain new artes and skills or change your class you will likely swap out artes and skills. Don’t sweat it if you’re removing an upgraded arte or skill because you can just keep getting BP. Also, upgrading to level 3 is relatively cheap compared to the level 4 and 5 (max level) upgrades so don’t hesitate to upgrade to at least level 3.</p>

<p><strong>Pick a class that interests you and change it once you max that class out.</strong> You start out as a Drifter which is a generic class. Once you max (i.e. level 10) this freelancer class out, you can pick a more specialized branch to pursue. Different branches have access to different weapons like assault rifles, longswords, photon sabers, ray-guns. When you master the end of a class branch, you’ll have access to the weapons for that class using ANY other class. For example, once you master the Astral Crusader class you can use a Sniper Rifle and Javelin and all their related artes paired with any other class. In short, you will likely max out at least two or three classes during the game so don’t worry too much about picking a class early on.</p>

<p><strong>Characters who join your party cannot change their class.</strong> Unlike the main character who can change classes and maxes out these classes at level 10, characters with a fixed class max that class out at level 20. Note that you’re still responsible for setting and upgrading their artes and skills and outfitting them with better gear. Also, characters that join later on will have all the BP you have gathered thus far so you shouldn’t feel rushed to recruit all characters immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Fill in the Collectopaedia for rewards.</strong> Items collected while exploring Mira can be registered in the Collectopaedia which can be accessed from Intel in the main menu. Be aware that registering an item consumes one of that item. But filling in the Collectopaedia will not only satisfy your inner completionist, you’ll also gain rewards like Battle Points along the way.</p>

<p>Wow! This list turned out a lot longer than I had intended. But it’s to be expected as Xenoblade Chronicles X is massive.

Happy exploring!</p>

    <p>It’s finally here! After waiting for what’s seemed like an eternity – from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GxUMMGyZcM">reveal trailer</a> in early 2013 – <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X</strong> for the Wii U has finally landed on North American shores.</p>

<p>I’ve put a few hours into the game and there is one word that describes how I feel right now: <strong>overwhelmed</strong>. It’s not that bad, suffocating overwhelmed feeling; it’s a pleasantly-smothering eagerness to take on a daunting task.</p>

<p>I knew the open world in this game was huge, but the amount of things to do and game mechanics to explore are equally large in scale. I’m beyond excited to dive in and explore the world of Mira! Christmas has certainly come early for me this year for me!</p>
