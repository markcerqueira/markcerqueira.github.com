   <title>Changing Progress Bar Spinner Color</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Situation: you’ve got a little progress spinner in your Android app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ProgressBar&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:indeterminateOnly=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s grey. You want it to be a different color. Something more exciting. To the Googles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many Android things, there are multiple Stack Overflow posts with all sorts of answers and comments on each one saying “Thanks” and “That doesn’t work for me.” I cut through all that and here is how you do it programmatically and it works across all API levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/36828947&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ContextCompat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;favorite_color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myProgressBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getIndeterminateDrawable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setColorFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PorterDuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;SRC_IN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Why try-catch? Because some Xiaomi device out there will probably choke...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProgressBar&lt;/code&gt; – that’s actually a spinner and not a bar – be colored!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ruby DateTime to Objective-C NSDate</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/30/ruby-datetime-nsdate/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/30/ruby-datetime-nsdate</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Converting a Ruby DateTime to an Objective-C NSDate will lead you on a wonderful journey where you realize the DateTime outputs itself is incompatible with any potential NSDateFormatter you try to use to parse it. The crux of this is because &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/7115343/265791&quot;&gt;DateTime includes a colon in its timezone offset&lt;/a&gt; which you cannot express in a NSDateFormatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is one to do? One option is to skip the default formatter of DateTime and roll your own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# See http://stackoverflow.com/a/9132422/265791&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;my_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then build the corresponding formatter in Objective-C:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-objective-c&quot;&gt;[dateFormatter setDateFormat:@&quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss&quot;];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, you too can avoid the fruitless journey of trying to get NSDateFormatter to comprehend DateTime’s default format. Happy interoperating with languages!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Concert Review: Final Symphony, San Francisco, 7/28/16</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/28/concert-review-final-symphony/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/28/concert-review-final-symphony</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s quite a sight to behold seeing Davies Symphony Hall packed (2,743 seats!) for a music concert centered around video game music. But when you are talking about one of the most iconic game series – Final Fantasy – with some of the most beloved soundtracks, it all kind of makes sense. Attending &lt;strong&gt;Final Symphony: Music from Final Fantasy VI, VII, and X&lt;/strong&gt;, I expected to hear a beautiful homage to some of the most popular games in the series. While the San Francisco Symphony put on an absolutely spectacular show, I left the concert feeling very &lt;strong&gt;underwhelmed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-07-28/fs.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Music from&quot; should be taken very loosely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main problem with Final Symphony is &lt;strong&gt;all the pieces were over-composed&lt;/strong&gt; to the point that they lost their identity as being a part of Final Fantasy. The concert was described as having “Music from Final Fantasy” but a more accurate description would be “Symphonies with riffs from Final Fantasy here and there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went in expecting something like Distant Worlds (i.e. Final Fantasy pieces adapted for orchestra) with a pizzazz to turn them into symphonies. But what I got was fragments of soundtracks, build-ups to “the really good part of a song” that would abandon ship right before climaxing, and dissonance used far too liberally. Ultimately, it just didn’t feel like Final Fantasy to me. It didn’t remind me of all the wonderful memories I had playing and falling in love with the games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected and wanted the composers to open up the original MIDI files, spruce them up a bit for live performance, hit Print, and put that in front of a world-class orchestra. What I got was something that felt really “try hard” and ended up really cheapening the experience for me. Expectations… They can really backfire sometimes!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hello, Euler!</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/18/hello-euler/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/18/hello-euler</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I was browsing a coworker’s repositories on GitHub and noticed one inconspicuously called &lt;strong&gt;euler&lt;/strong&gt;. And that’s how I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuler.net/&quot;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt;! The website describes the project as “a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t describe myself as a math aficionado, but have had a blast working my way through the problems. So far, I have already picked up a lot about prime numbers and touched the ceilings of number-based data structures many times! With over 500 problems (and a new one every week), I’ll be able to keep myself occupied for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like my coworker I now too have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/euler&quot;&gt;euler repository&lt;/a&gt; that you can browse.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pokémon Go</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/12/pokemon-go/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/12/pokemon-go</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, the world was forever changed with the release of &lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt; a.k.a. Nintendo letting Niantic reskin Ingress with Pokémon to make tons of money. I’ve been playing the game for a few days and it’s fun. Walking around outside and seeing tons of people playing this game was truly unexpected; I never imagined “Pokémon on mobile” was going to be delivered like this. It’s refreshing – both to be outdoors and to see gamers who are traditionally recluse out and mingling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-07-12/pokemon.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So many people outside!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the game has its fair share of issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The game is very &lt;strong&gt;buggy&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve had it crash and completely lock up at least twice each day since installing it. I’m sure stability will increase with coming patches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servers&lt;/strong&gt; are having trouble keeping up with the huge spike in popularity. This isn’t too shocking. It reminds me of how terrible the servers were for the rebooted Final Fantasy XIV back in 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s also been some &lt;strong&gt;privacy&lt;/strong&gt; complaints about the iOS version having full access to your Google account. Given how buggy the app is, I was not shocked when they said it was a configuration mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This game destroys my &lt;strong&gt;battery&lt;/strong&gt;. Got 80% battery left? You mean 80 minutes left of Pokémon Go playing time! I can now empathize with Android users who live under the tyranny of terrible battery life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing people in with the Pokémon IP and getting them into the Ingress geo-caching game model has been successful so far, but Pokémon Go is just scratching the surface today. I’m really hoping Niantic is cranking on social features. I’d love to have a friends list, trade Pokémon, get bonuses for hanging out with other trainers, make clans, gift Pokémon to friends, and see friends on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Authenticating Programmatically Sent Emails</title>

   <id>/2016/07/10/authenticating-programmatically-sent-emails</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Work on the Ruby and Sinatra project continues and this weekend I worked on creating a helper method for sending emails so I can have users confirm the emails they used to register. I wanted to send emails from a mailbox I set up on a custom domain I’m hosting with DreamHost. I created a mailbox on DreamHost’s admin panel and with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikel/mail&quot;&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; Ruby gem it was pretty straightforward to get emails sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Test Body'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit and the endpoint and you’re done! Or are you? To the Gmail inbox!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-07-10/spammer.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gmail has some doubts!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All looks good except Gmail ominously warns us: &lt;strong&gt;“Gmail couldn’t verify that chuckpad.io actually sent this message.”&lt;/strong&gt; This means “Gmail doesn’t know if the message is coming from the person who appears to be sending it,” which makes our messages excellent candidates to get caught by Gmail’s spam filters! Read more about authenticated messages &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/180707?hl=en&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some digging around, I learned about &lt;strong&gt;Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records&lt;/strong&gt;. Basically, a DNS record can have some metadata which identifies which servers are permitted to send email on behalf of the domain. DreamHost’s default &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/220854287-What-SPF-records-do-I-use-&quot;&gt;“SPF information doesn’t include DreamHost’s mail servers”&lt;/a&gt; because you can always opt to host your domain’s mail servers elsewhere. Fortunately, this can be easily remedied by &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216106197-How-do-I-add-an-SPF-record-&quot;&gt;adding the SPF record&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;v=spf1 include:netblocks.dreamhost.com&lt;/strong&gt; to our domain’s DNS record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-07-10/spf.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gmail's doubts are gone!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give the DNS caches of the world a few hours to refresh, try again, and boom! &lt;strong&gt;Success! Programmatic and authenticated!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thoughts on Star Ocean 5</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/06/thoughts-on-star-ocean-5/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/06/thoughts-on-star-ocean-5</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week after its release, I beat &lt;strong&gt;Star Ocean Integrity and Faithlessness&lt;/strong&gt; a.k.a. Star Ocean 5. Here are some of my thoughts on the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The game is &lt;strong&gt;short&lt;/strong&gt;: I beat it in 24 hours doing about 70% of the side quests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;story&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty poor. It’s easily the weakest in the series.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I liked the cast of &lt;strong&gt;characters&lt;/strong&gt; and the voice-acting was pretty good! Each character was unique and memorable. The story didn’t do the characters enough justice but the optional Private Actions gave some opportunities for development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The battle system is good, but the &lt;strong&gt;AI was terrible&lt;/strong&gt; at making all characters useful. Heal spells always seemed to be improperly timed!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;cutscenes&lt;/strong&gt; were implemented was lazy and really hurt the delivery of the already-bad story. Cutscenes were rendered without any special handling and would let the player walk around and control the camera. This likely saved a lot of development time as cutscenes did not need to be “directed” but really cheapened each scene.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;camera&lt;/strong&gt; was bad: too close to the character and too jarring when moving around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was too much &lt;strong&gt;backtracking&lt;/strong&gt; without early fast travel options.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The option to have orchestrated &lt;strong&gt;battle music&lt;/strong&gt; from Valkyrie Profile was great! This reminded me how much I want Valkyrie Profile 3 to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So much potential squandered!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s the weakest entry in the series so far. Even though I just finished trashing the game pretty hard, I powered through it because it was fun to play (I’m a masochist). Along with the Tales series I always considered Star Ocean to be a reliable source for decent JRPGs. This game sadly makes me question that. &lt;strong&gt;I would not recommend buying the game at the $60 price-tag, but if you find this game in the bargain bin, I’d recommend picking it up if you’re hungry for a JRPG.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you write some code and want to share it with the world, &lt;strong&gt;don’t forget to add a license&lt;/strong&gt;! Posting code on a public repository on GitHub and allowing people to incorporate that code into their own products are not one and the same. So add a license please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will all things, there are tons of licenses for you to pick from. &lt;a href=&quot;http://choosealicense.com/&quot;&gt;choosealicense.com&lt;/a&gt; has a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://choosealicense.com/licenses/&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on the most commonly used licenses. Basically, if you want to let people use your code without too many restrictions go with the &lt;strong&gt;MIT License&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go forth! Code, slap a license on it, and share it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Resetting Sequences in PostgreSQL on Heroku</title>
   <link href="/2016/06/22/resetting-sequences-postgresql-heroku/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/06/22/resetting-sequences-postgresql-heroku</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/26/evernote-hackathon-report&quot;&gt;Glatering&lt;/a&gt; – a world-class Rails app with a Postgres database I’m running on Heroku – kicked the bucket! Time to debug… To the Heroku logs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; 
~ heroku logs --app &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;app_name&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    ActionView::Template::Error
    PG::UniqueViolation: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;events_pkey&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    Rendered welcome/index.html.erb within layouts/application &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;324.8ms&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    Completed 500 Internal Server Error &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;413ms &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;ActiveRecord: 90.0ms&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    DETAIL: Key &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)=(&lt;/span&gt;47&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; already exists.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like when we were creating a new event object the auto-assigned id for it (which has to be unique) already existed in the database. We were trying to use id 47 when the database had an event with that id already in it. This is weird because that id should be assigned and auto-incremented for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we do? &lt;strong&gt;Get Postgres to check itself&lt;/strong&gt; a.k.a. reset the value “events_pkey” to a valid value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect to the database, I use my favorite Postgres GUI &lt;a href=&quot;https://eggerapps.at/postico/&quot;&gt;Postico&lt;/a&gt;. All the information you need to connect to the database (e.g. user, password, host, database name) is in the Heroku DATABASE_URL environmental variable in the Settings section of the app dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; 
~ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$DATABASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;
    postgres://&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;password&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;@&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;host&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;port&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;database&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once connected, click on SQL query, paste the query below (and replace events with the name of the table you’re having issues with), and hit Execute Statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; 
SELECT pg_catalog.setval&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pg_get_serial_sequence&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'events'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, MAX&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; FROM events;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom! Hopefully your database is still in one piece, your Postgres sequence should be reset it, and it won’t generate duplicate ids any more!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Producing JSON Arrays in Ruby</title>
   <link href="/2016/06/14/json-arrays-ruby/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/06/14/json-arrays-ruby</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a project and building the backend with Ruby and Sinatra. So far so good, until I wanted to take a list of objects I fetched from ActiveRecord and produce a JSON array. I had a function set up to JSONify a single object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Returns passed model as a hash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# This is separate from to_json because we'll use it later!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to_hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Returns JSON for given model&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to_json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending this to produce a JSON array for a bunch of model objects is simple for anyone who is familiar with Ruby…. Something I’m clearly not! Here’s the clean solution I eventually got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Returns JSON for given models&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to_json_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each_with_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to_json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the laughs (and sadness), here was my initial (and ghetto) implementation of to_json_list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Ghetto but I wasn't able to find a better way to do this!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to_json_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'['&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;','&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;']'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing the above method with the single-line version felt almost as good as removing that # Ghetto comment!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nuking Permission Errors on El Capitan</title>
   <link href="/2016/06/08/nuking-permission-errors-on-el-capitan/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/06/08/nuking-permission-errors-on-el-capitan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a home server running El Capitan (10.11.5). The other day when a cron job failed to send out some emails, I took a look and was &lt;strong&gt;horrified&lt;/strong&gt; to find my Desktop folder (yes, I have my source code folder on the Desktop) had its &lt;strong&gt;permissions totally borked&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried the usual solutions: ran Software Update, restarted (twice), chmod-ed everything, tried modifying permissions from the Get Info pop-up, ran Disk Utility’s First Aid, &lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2015/11/04/verify-repair-permissions-mac-os-x/&quot;&gt;repaired disk permissions&lt;/a&gt; from the command line (El Capitan removed this from Disk Utility for some reason), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kb.parallels.com/en/120432&quot;&gt;reset home folder permissions and ACLs&lt;/a&gt; (access control lists not anterior cruciate ligament). &lt;strong&gt;None of this did the trick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In desperation &lt;strong&gt;I took to the internet to find random things to paste into the command line&lt;/strong&gt;, preferably with &lt;strong&gt;sudo&lt;/strong&gt; in it! I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5182705?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;a post on Apple’s help forums&lt;/a&gt; by Linc Davis; I’ve seen him post plenty of helpful things in the past and he is Level 10 with 204,169 points which is a lot of credibility points in my book. His solution was to paste this bad boy (which unlocks all your user files and resets their ownership and ACLs to defaults) into the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; sudo chflags -R nouchg,nouappnd ~ &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TMPDIR&lt;/span&gt;.. ; sudo chown -R &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$UID&lt;/span&gt;:staff ~ &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; ; sudo chmod -R u+rwX ~ &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; ; chmod -R -N ~ &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; ; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 2&amp;gt; /dev/null&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it worked!&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks, Linc!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep this bad boy around for the inevitable future permissions mishaps. And I also discovered a new requirement for anything I paste into the command line: piping the output of standard error to /dev/null blackhole (i.e. 2&amp;gt; /dev/null)!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>StarCraft - Bad Weather Co-op Mission Tips</title>
   <link href="/2016/06/06/starcraft-co-op-bad-weather-tips/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/06/06/starcraft-co-op-bad-weather-tips</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a recent update to the cooperative (co-op) game mode in StarCraft 2, Blizzard introduced &lt;strong&gt;mutation challenges&lt;/strong&gt;. Mutations change every week and take an existing mission and add mutations to it. Mutations are essentially handicaps like reduced vision for your units, enemy speed increased, and other things that generally make the mission more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-06-06/mutations.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why yes! I thought exactly that!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s mutation challenge &lt;strong&gt;Bad Weather&lt;/strong&gt; is incredibly challenging (seemingly impossible at first) on Brutal difficulty. A mutation causes Void Rifts to periodically appear in random locations and these rifts spawn enemy units until destroyed. If you don’t take care of the Void Rifts quickly, you’ll easily get overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the mission is do-able! Spencer and I beat it using Karax and Vorazun. Here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karax will one-base the whole game&lt;/strong&gt;. The Vorazun player should expand as early as possible and let Karax handle early attacks. Holding the right expansion seems a bit easier so have your party leader be Karax (leader spawns in the left position).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karax focuses exclusively on &lt;strong&gt;base defense the entire game&lt;/strong&gt;. Build Photon Cannons, Khaydarin Monoliths, and Shield Batteries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karax should get the &lt;strong&gt;Solar Forge efficiency upgrades&lt;/strong&gt; because Orbital Strike and Solar Lance are helpful in tight spots.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Vorazun’s Shadow Guard to take out the first Void Shard and if you’re lucky, snipe one or two Void Rifts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vorazun should expand early and go &lt;strong&gt;mass Dark Templar&lt;/strong&gt; (DT). You’ll be lacking anti-air, but with high DPS and Blink, DTs can get in, do damage, and run away from any trouble in the air. Also because of Emergency Recall any DTs that die will get recalled to your Nexus, which greatly lessens pressure on your economy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The general strategy for destroying Void Shards: once you have a handful of DTs, move out on the map and destroy Void Rifts while &lt;strong&gt;Time Stop&lt;/strong&gt; is on cooldown. When Time Stop is about to be ready move towards the area where Void Shards are. When Time Stop is ready, activate it, and push onto Void Shards. Sometimes we sniped Void Shards and ran away; other times, we cleared enemies and then took out the Void Shards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you have DTs clearing Void Rifts on the map, have Karax put down some static defense at the expansion on the left (the one Karax does not take) and have &lt;strong&gt;Vorazun take those gases&lt;/strong&gt; to bring her total Assimilator count to 6. A few Photon Cannons and a Khaydarin Monolith should do the trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won’t be easy, but it’s do-able. I’m even tempted to try to best it again. Good luck, commanders!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Global Running Day</title>
   <link href="/2016/06/01/global-running-day/"/>

   <id>/2016/06/01/global-running-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalrunningday.org/&quot;&gt;Global Running Day&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a huge fan of running. My four mile runs every weekday wake me up physically (and mentally) and are the cornerstone to a great day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started running in college to get in better shape. I ran pretty slowly and got injured pretty quickly into my journey. Today I’m much healthier, run a little faster, can cover longer distances, and get injured less often. Post-running ice packs are a godsend! Not running feels strange now and makes me very uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever considered running as an exercise, I highly recommend you give it a shot. It’s changed my life in so many wonderful ways. And you don’t need to run fast; just run at a pace that doesn’t kill you. Before you know it, you’ll be running faster and longer distances. And soon thereafter, you’ll be hooked and call yourself a runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting that up and running, I quickly got a feature request: “it’d be really cool if it could send a text message too!” I’m a strong believer in ask (kindly) and you (may) receive…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-26/twilio.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up automated text messages was a breeze with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;. The API is super simple and just works. And it’s pretty cheap too: $1.00 a month for a number (needed to send text messages) and under one cent ($0.0075) per text message sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updated code can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/kendo-emailer&quot;&gt;kendo-emailer on Github&lt;/a&gt;. TwilioHelper and TwilioConfiguration are the main files to look at if you’re interested in setting up Twilio yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Build, Deploy, Improve</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When building something it’s easy to get hung up on how incomplete something is or how far off it is from the awesome (and complicated) idea in your head. But that shouldn’t stop you from building things and putting those things out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of minimal viable product (MVP) gets thrown around a lot when people talk about their hot new idea, but I prefer building a &lt;strong&gt;minimally useful product&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s not radically different; just a change in mindset. Don’t aim for building something “capable of growing or developing;” aim for building something with “&lt;strong&gt;a beneficial use&lt;/strong&gt;” in version 1.0. Then, nurture and grow that beneficial use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a simple problem, and solve it. Then expand the scope of the problem and solve that. Rinse and repeat. Keep &lt;strong&gt;building&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep &lt;strong&gt;deploying&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep &lt;strong&gt;improving&lt;/strong&gt;. Aiming for perfection in the first release will prevent you from ever releasing or even worse, starting to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day and your awesome idea won’t be either.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We Need More Bathroom Lock Indicators</title>

   <id>/2016/05/22/we-need-more-bathroom-lock-indicators</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was a child the future had flying cars. But as I exit my extended stay in childhood, all I want from the future is the &lt;strong&gt;proliferation of bathroom indicator locks&lt;/strong&gt;. Approaching a bathroom unsure if someone is using it is very awkward. Give the knob a firm turn and you’re horrified to find it locked! The person inside the bathroom is equally uncomfortable. You didn’t mean to invade their space, but you did. Why!? There wasn’t an indicator to let you know if the door was locked or unlocked. It’s a terrible experience for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-22/indicator_lock.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we already have the technology to solve this problem. You’ve definitely seen it in action on an airplane. And if you’re lucky, you may have seen this magical device on terra firma. &lt;strong&gt;Let’s make our bathrooms better. Let’s give them all indicator locks!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Auto-Deploying This Blog</title>
   <link href="/2016/05/20/auto-deploying-this-blog/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/05/20/auto-deploying-this-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A long time ago I started &lt;strong&gt;generating my site locally and pushing it up to Github manually&lt;/strong&gt; because Github Pages does not allow you to run custom plugins. This isn’t as painful as it sounds. A friendly internet hero – ixti – crafted a nice Rakefile that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html&quot;&gt;automated publishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But doing the publishing myself led to some workflow issues.&lt;/strong&gt; Allowing GitHub Pages to do the work for you is nice because you only have to deal with one branch. Make changes to that branch, push to GitHub, and GitHub Pages would generate the site and deploy it. Everything is always in sync. The new workflow had me writing and crafting content on the source branch and then using the publishing command to generate my site locally and then it would push it to the master branch: the “deploy.” &lt;strong&gt;Separating the crafting and deploying steps meant I sometimes published content without pushing it into the source branch or I’d push content and not deploy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-20/travis.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous deployment via Travis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html&quot;&gt;2016’s automation resolution&lt;/a&gt;, I set up my blog to auto-deploy itself. Using and adapting Domenic Denicola’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/domenic/ec8b0fc8ab45f39403dd&quot;&gt;clear and helpful instructions&lt;/a&gt;, the new set-up has &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/markcerqueira/markcerqueira.github.com&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; run the automated publishing flow when any changes are pushed to the source branch. Turns out Travis is not only a great continuous integration tool, but can be adapted to be continuously deploying as well! No more pushing content to the source branch and running the publishing command locally; &lt;strong&gt;I’m back to just needing to push once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The blog's gotten big so rake publish pushes 75.05 MiB!&lt;/span&gt;
Writing objects: 100% &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;1052/1052&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, 75.05 MiB | 1.46 MiB/s, &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;.
Total 1052 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;delta 166&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, reused 0 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;delta 0&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
To git@github.com:markcerqueira/markcerqueira.github.com.git
 + f2e99be...3aea10b master -&amp;gt; master &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;forced update&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are a few more benefits including &lt;strong&gt;email notifications if something goes wrong&lt;/strong&gt; during the publishing flow and &lt;strong&gt;no need to wait on a 70+ MB push&lt;/strong&gt; when publishing, which is great when I’m tethered or in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minor improvement isn’t mind-blowing, but it does make my interaction with blogging more streamlined and simple. That’s what my automating 2016 resolution is all about. Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git push origin &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# We're done. Walk away. Go outside. Eat a banana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

   <title>Useful Utilities   Alfred + Dash</title>
   <link href="/2016/05/16/useful-utilities-alfred-dash/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/05/16/useful-utilities-alfred-dash</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a big fan of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; productivity app for a while now. It’s like Mac’s built-in Spotlight but more feature-rich and more extendable. I’m a big fan of the clipboard history feature: it preserves all the text you copy and lets you paste from a list of &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the text you previously copied. The tyranny of losing what you copied after hitting cmd+c is over! Alfred is highly customizable and I’ll readily admit I don’t take advantage of all it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-16/alfred_clipboard_history.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say goodbye to losing the things you previously copied!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://kapeli.com/dash&quot;&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt;. It puts API documentation a simple keystroke away! If you’re a developer it’s nice to be able to quickly pull up documentation on a method or review all the methods a particular class has to offer. Being able to skip out on going to Google Chrome and searching for the documentation page makes this workflow much faster… And lessens the chance I’ll go to YouTube to watch more cat videos. I forgot to mention it also works offline, supports personal annotations, and storing custom code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-16/dash_api.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing really simple about SimpleDateFormatter!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to have amazing tools at one’s disposal. But it’s truly breathtaking when those tools work well together. Alfred and Dash have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/productivity/dash-quicker-api-documentation-search/&quot;&gt;awesome integration&lt;/a&gt; that brings Dash’s API searching capabilities to Alfred. Now I can get the API of my favorite data structure – LinkedHashMap – even faster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-16/alfred_dash.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedHashMaps are awesome!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both tools have free versions, but getting a license to fully unlock them won’t break the bank: for $50, you’ll get full access to both tools. Take my word for it; you’ll definitely find that to be a steal if you leverage a fraction of these tools’ feature sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit late to the party (given the integration announcement is from August 2015), but if I can pass along this information to at least one person who didn’t know about either of these awesome productivity tools, it’ll be worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Useful Utilities - AppCleaner</title>
   <link href="/2016/05/12/useful-utilities-appcleaner/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/05/12/useful-utilities-appcleaner</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Deleting Mac apps is pretty simple: drag the application into the Trash. But most apps leave behind some (or a lot) of preference files, caches, and launch daemon configurations. These leftovers don’t harm your system or impact system performance, but you don’t really need them either. There are a ton of uninstall utilities, but my favorite is &lt;strong&gt;AppCleaner&lt;/strong&gt; because it’s &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;powerful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #cdcdcd;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-12/app_clean_source_tree.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry SourceTree... I like Tower a lot more!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about AppCleaner is you can turn on &lt;strong&gt;SmartDelete&lt;/strong&gt; from its Preference pane. SmartDelete detects when apps are deleted and automatically finds and offers to delete associated files. This is nice because you don’t have to remember to launch AppCleaner; it’ll automatically wake up when it realizes it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Spring cleaning for your Applications folder is around the corner, be sure to grab &lt;a href=&quot;https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/&quot;&gt;AppCleaner&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Improving Starcraft's Co-op</title>
   <link href="/2016/05/08/starcraft-co-op/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/05/08/starcraft-co-op</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spencer and I celebrate an important achievement today: we &lt;strong&gt;maxed out all the heroes in Starcraft’s cooperative mode&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-08/starcraft.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-op mode was one of those unexpected surprises that we ended up really enjoying and spending a lot of time playing. Spending a lot of time with anything, you invariably come up with a bunch of wants and asks. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re reading this, Blizzard, take heed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add a survival mission&lt;/strong&gt; like In Utter Darkness from the Wings of Liberty campaign. This would be like the current Temple of the Past co-op mission but instead of only needing to survive for 25 minutes you would fight until you are completely overwhelmed. You can even add a leaderboard to encourage people to survive as long as possible. People love leaderboards!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more heroes.&lt;/strong&gt; Given the time it takes to max out a hero, this is the easiest way to increase play-time (besides increasing the level cap).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow resource sharing&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, this could devolve into one person feeding another but who cares? Make it like multiplayer where you cannot share until after a certain point in the game or add a penalty (e.g. 10% tax on resources shared) to discourage it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more missions.&lt;/strong&gt; Even better (and ultimately easier for you), allow people to create their own co-op missions like you can create maps and custom games. Let people play these custom missions and vote on them. The top missions can get promoted to “official” co-op missions featured more prominently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add “over-the-top” bonus objectives.&lt;/strong&gt; Give players incentives to take risks to make the mid to late game more exciting. Even on brutal difficulty, once you make it to the mid-game the challenge drops off considerably. Encourage spreading armies, going deep into enemy territory, or building strange unit compositions to up the ante.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’d be nice to see some of these and other improvements to co-op mode. But realistically, given the pace at which Blizzard has been updating co-op mode, we likely won’t see much in the near future. I’d love to be proven wrong here though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; One day later and Blizzard announced they’re releasing &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/20112699&quot;&gt;some updates to co-op mode in the upcoming 3.3 patch&lt;/a&gt;. There will be weekly “mutators” that enhance difficulty for specific missions, and mastery levels (all the way to 90!) which are similar to Diablo 3’s paragon level. It also looks like Abathur might be joining the ranks of heroes! Also, check out the accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF85EY0SY7s&quot;&gt;update video&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll take it! GG, Blizzard!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Java Hasn't Changed Much</title>
   <link href="/2016/05/06/java-change/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/05/06/java-change</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I was digging through some email and found an email thread with fabulous AP Computer Science teacher, Mr. Gironda. The attachments? My very first submitted programming assignment in Java. Fun fact: we called these assignments programming projects or &lt;strong&gt;PPs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/markcerqueira/502d9081034cd0190cbf64a38aa1b19c&quot;&gt;gist of the PP code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-06/g.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Gironda and me when I had hair on my head!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PP involved programming a dumb ATM. Mark of 2005 helpfully left a comment to explain why it was dumb: “user inputs how much money they have to begin with, which is why the ATM is so dumb. Other than that I would consider this ATM a superior form of intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-05-06/static.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's me calling a static method on an instance of the class...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the code (which wasn’t 100% correct), &lt;strong&gt;I realize not a lot has changed between me and Java&lt;/strong&gt;, except my coding style: I switched from Allman to K&amp;amp;R indentation and I always use braces even if my conditional only executes a single line of code. I also &lt;strong&gt;check for null and try-catch excessively&lt;/strong&gt; now because, as we all know, that’s all that separates amateur coders from professional developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java – the programming language – hasn’t changed much and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I’ll gladly take syntactic sugar updates (e.g. look at declaring an array of numbers in Objective-C before and after 2012), new APIs, and anything that makes me write less boilerplate code. &lt;strong&gt;But I don’t expect or really want a language to fundamentally change&lt;/strong&gt;. A spoken language doesn’t radically change overnight; words and concepts pop up, some die, some survive, and it feels natural because it’s never too large a leap from where it started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay old, Java.&lt;/strong&gt; If we’re really craving something fresh, we can always count on Gradle to drag it in.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stop Jekyll Upgrades</title>
   <link href="/2016/05/02/stop-jekyll-upgrades/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/05/02/stop-jekyll-upgrades</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I build my blog with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and I love it. But &lt;strong&gt;I dread any time I accidentally update the Jekyll gem&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything breaks and it takes a lot of trial-and-error to get things working again. It doesn’t help that I’m a noob at Ruby, RubyGems, and the internal workings of Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m putting a stop to this madness and using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bundler.io/rationale.html&quot;&gt;Ruby bundler&lt;/a&gt; for its designed purpose and am &lt;strong&gt;version-locking Jekyll to version 2.4.0&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Lock Jekyll to version 2.4.0 in the Gemfile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gemfile &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;gem 'jekyll', '2.4.0'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gemfile

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Back up Gemfile.lock. You can delete this if everything succeeds after.&lt;/span&gt;
mv Gemfile.lock Gemfile.lock.backup

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Reset all Gems&lt;/span&gt;
sudo bundle clean --force
bundle install

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Run Jekyll, but use bundle exec to run the specific version&lt;/span&gt;
bundle &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that commands like jekyll and rake now need to be run with through &lt;strong&gt;bundle exec&lt;/strong&gt;. If you just run jekyll directly, it’ll run the most up-to-date one that is installed to your default path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup now lets me take control of when I’ll have to suffer through a Jekyll upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. I still &amp;lt;3 you Jekyll!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the three year celebration of the mark.gg blog. In the past year I was a bit of a slacker so only &lt;strong&gt;35 posts&lt;/strong&gt; were published. Over &lt;strong&gt;10,000 people&lt;/strong&gt; visited the blog racking up over &lt;strong&gt;14,000 pageviews&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Acing Technical Interviews</title>
   <link href="/2016/04/10/acing-technical-interviews/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/04/10/acing-technical-interviews</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Technical interviews are a pain. But here’s a 2-step plan to ace them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick Java as your programming language du jour.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html&quot;&gt;LinkedHashMaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HashMap is great and usually the go-to data structure during an interview. But an interviewer who’s a jerk will always try to unnecessarily put down the HashMap. Here’s how that conversation might go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; HashMap, eh? But what if you want to keep the map to a certain size by removing the oldest entry when you hit the size limit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you know about the LinkedHashMap method removeEldestEntry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; What if you want to have the performance of a map but you want to know the order things were put in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you know keys can be iterated over in insertion-order? And before you ask - yes, you can iterate over the items in the order they were accessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interview:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow! You really know a lot! But can you reverse a linked list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes I may know how to do something I would never actually do if you hired me, but did you know that internally the LinkedHashMap implementation maintains a doubly-linked list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow! You’re great! When can you start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve already converted every pleb data structure in your codebase into a LinkedHashMap. &lt;strong&gt;*walk out*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom! You’re hired!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Good Engineers Are Great At Search Engines</title>
   <link href="/2016/04/06/good-engineers-are-great-at-search-engines/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/04/06/good-engineers-are-great-at-search-engines</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some technical interviews may have you believe that a good engineer is someone who can flatten binary trees efficiently, regurgitate performance of red-black trees, or solve some tricky puzzle. That could be the case in an algorithms course, but that’s not the case in the real world. What separates bad from good when it comes to engineers is one’s &lt;strong&gt;search engine proficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation: you’re faced with a problem (a bug) or a very serious problem (someone asking you to implement some snazzy new feature). You break the problem down into small units of work and start tackling them one by one. And before you know it, you run into an issue. What happens now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good engineers run to google.com and start looking for an answer. It is very unlikely that you are the first person running into your particular problem. So leverage that fact! Good Google-fu will usually get you to an answer or at least orient you in the right direction. The worst outcome is finding absolutely nothing or — even worse — a StackOverflow post from many years ago with no answers. In that unfortunate case, you’re going to have to actually be an engineer and do some sleuthing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good engineers get from not knowing the answer to delivering the correct answer &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Good Job, Square Enix</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/30/good-job-square-enix/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/30/good-job-square-enix</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Say what you will about Square Enix, but lately I think they’re dishing outs lots of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The release date for &lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/strong&gt; was announced and it’s only 6 months away: September 30th! Can’t wait? No worries! Square Enix also released the &lt;strong&gt;Platinum Demo&lt;/strong&gt; for you to check out today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not only are we getting a game, Final Fantasy XV will also have a short animated series called &lt;strong&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/strong&gt; to introduce the FFXV story. And there will also be a full-length feature CGI film called &lt;strong&gt;Kingsglaive&lt;/strong&gt;. You can watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsVhwsUFaDE&quot;&gt;first episode of Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otB3zq6ppwc&quot;&gt;Kingsglaive trailer&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bravely Second: End Layer&lt;/strong&gt; hits North American shores in two weeks. If you long for a Final Fantasy that is more traditional, stop complaining about the modern Final Fantasy games and pick up this awesome old-school JRPG. If you somehow haven’t played the original Bravely Default yet, do it now!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The beloved &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Quest VII and Dragon Quest VIII&lt;/strong&gt; will be re-released on the 3DS in North America in 2016. Originally released on the Playstation and Playstation 2 respectively, these re-releases will bring the number of Dragon Quest games you can play on a North American 3DS to six (i.e. IV through IX)!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The North American release date for &lt;strong&gt;Star Ocean 5&lt;/strong&gt; was also announced this week: June 28th! Entries in the series since the beloved Star Ocean 2 have received mixed reviews, but with a solid 34/40 from Famitsu, Star Ocean 5 is shaping up to be a solid JRPG entry in 2016. Not appealing enough? The Day One Edition will allow you swap out the battle music with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconera.com/2016/03/30/star-ocean-5-will-get-day-one-edition-launches-june-28-north-america/&quot;&gt;Valkyrie Profile battle themes&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great stuff! The only thing missing here is a Valkyrie Profile 3 announcement!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Breaking Codenames with Binary</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/28/breaking-codenames-with-binary/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/28/breaking-codenames-with-binary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codenames&lt;/strong&gt; is an incredibly fun, deep, and addicting tabletop game. The game revolves around a 5 x 5 grid of words. Two teams race to pick out the eight (or nine if you go first) words that belong to your team. Two spymasters give their teams one-word clues that will hopefully guide their teammates to their respective words on a 5 x 5 board. Clues that let teams pick more words correctly are better. The first team to get all their words win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun. It’s funny. It’s hard. But we can make this game easy, not fun, and more like a math exercise. How? &lt;strong&gt;With binary!&lt;/strong&gt; We can do this because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While a particular word can be blue (one team), red (the other team), black (instant loss if selected), or beige (turn ends immediately) &lt;strong&gt;we only care about whether it’s a word belonging to our team or not&lt;/strong&gt;. Ours or not ours. Binary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The numbers from &lt;strong&gt;zero to a hundred can be expressed as SINGLE words&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, the numbers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grammarly.com/handbook/punctuation/hyphen/11/hyphen-in-compound-numbers/&quot;&gt;21 through 99 are hyphenated&lt;/a&gt;! This grammar technicality is powerful!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given we’re restricted to one word clues that will be numbers ranging from 0 to 100, we can &lt;strong&gt;usually express 6 bits of information&lt;/strong&gt; and sometimes 7. For reference, 111111 (6 bits) = 63, 1111111 (7 bits) = 127, 1000000 (7 bits) = 64. In some cases were we have a lot of 0s at the end, we will express less than 6 bits of information (e.g. 01 is equivalent to 000000001).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean? With 5 x 5 grid of words the spymaster has &lt;strong&gt;25 bits of information&lt;/strong&gt; they need to get across to their team. Using only one word you can transmit about 6 bits of information. So you’ll about need 5 turns to share 25 bits because 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 &amp;gt; 25. But depending on how the words you need to pick are placed (i.e. the last few spaces on the board do not belong to your team so you’ll win before you need to share this information), and if you can squeeze in a 7-bit number, you’ll &lt;strong&gt;on average only need 4 turns to win&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what this would look like for a particular configuration. In this example, we’ll play the role of the red team. The red team goes first so we’ll need to pick out 9 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-28/codenames.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victory in 4 turns!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1st turn say “&lt;strong&gt;70&lt;/strong&gt;” - 1000110, 7 bits, yellow text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd turn say “&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;” - 10100, 5 bits, green text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3rd turn say “&lt;strong&gt;64&lt;/strong&gt;” - 1000000, 7 bits, pink text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4th turn say “&lt;strong&gt;44&lt;/strong&gt;” - 101100, 6 bits,  white text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the green text number (i.e. 10100) highlights the case mentioned above about expressing a lower than average amount of bits when we have a lot of 0s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends and I have played a lot but we have not gotten to the point where we can win in 4 turns. That said, are we going to use this system? &lt;strong&gt;Probably not…&lt;/strong&gt; since it ruins in the fun and, more importantly, breaks the rule that the clue must be &lt;a href=&quot;http://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf&quot;&gt;“about the meaning of the word.”&lt;/a&gt; That said, it was a fun thought exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Codenames, GeekDad wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekdad.com/2015/08/codenames/&quot;&gt;great overview and review&lt;/a&gt; or if you want to buy a copy hop on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Czech-Games-00031CGE-Codenames/dp/B014Q1XX9S/&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Automated Google Calendar Reminders Over Gmail</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/26/automated-calendar-reminders-gmail/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/26/automated-calendar-reminders-gmail</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I do instructor scheduling for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanfranciscokendo.org&quot;&gt;San Francisco Kendo Dojo&lt;/a&gt;. Google Calendar and creating events that repeat monthly solves most of the scheduling puzzle. But I was sometimes getting questions about who was teaching and when. I decided weekly reminders directly to instructors’ email inboxes with the week’s schedule was the way to keep everyone up-to-date. In keeping with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/01/automating-2016/&quot;&gt;2016’s automation goal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I decided to &lt;strong&gt;automate these weekly reminders&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-26/email.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An email sent from kendo-emailer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/kendo-emailer&quot;&gt;kendo-emailer&lt;/a&gt; is a Java-based project that uses the &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar and Gmail API&lt;/strong&gt;. It pulls events from the kendo instructor calendar, creates a nice email for any events within the next 2 weeks, and sends it to all the instructors. &lt;strong&gt;For anyone teaching in the coming week, their last name is put in the subject.&lt;/strong&gt; The idea here is that even if someone does not open the email, they will hopefully see their name in the subject line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-26/cronnix.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick and dirty cron with CronniX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/7486/cronnix&quot;&gt;CronniX&lt;/a&gt; to schedule weekly emails by running this project on my home server. To ensure I don’t email instructors anything weird I have the project email only me (preview mode) on Friday afternoon. If everything looks good, I don’t need to fix anything for the email sent to everyone (production mode) on Saturday. This preview/production system is a &lt;strong&gt;cheap and easy way to let me “deploy” code&lt;/strong&gt; that impacts people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to report that the reminder emails have been very well-received! I generalized &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/kendo-emailer&quot;&gt;kendo-emailer&lt;/a&gt; to share it without compromising personal information (e.g. instructor names and emails are pulled from a CSV file that is gitignored). I hope it’s helpful for anyone looking to do some automation with Google Calendar and Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Automated Meal</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/18/an-automated-meal/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/18/an-automated-meal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/01/automating-2016/&quot;&gt;2016’s automation resolution&lt;/a&gt; takes a step forward… in the kitchen! My friend Spencer was visiting from LA and I wanted to flex my cooking muscle. Turns out, I didn’t have to do much work myself because the &lt;strong&gt;meal was prepared mostly automatically&lt;/strong&gt; with the rather impressive collection of kitchen appliances!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-18/automated.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An easy, delicious, automated meal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sous vide&lt;/strong&gt; takes the guesswork out of cooking &lt;strong&gt;steaks&lt;/strong&gt; and produces reliable and delicious meat. I like to use a soy sauce-based marinade which imbues the tender steaks with a nice flavor profile. My sous vide setup is documented &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/12/how-i-sous-vide/&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice cookers&lt;/strong&gt; make preparing rice a piece of (rice) cake. The rice pictured above is Japanese brown rice prepared in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NS-TSC10-Uncooked-Cooker-1-0-Liter/dp/B0074CDG6C/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zojirushi NS-TSC10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I like Japanese brown rice because it has a more flavor and texture compared to regular brown rice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fresh loaf of bread is one of the greatest things in the world and &lt;strong&gt;bread machines&lt;/strong&gt; pump out fresh loaves like nobody’s business. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Cuisinart-CBK-100-Bread-Maker/dp/B001C2KY7Y/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conair Cuisinart CBK-100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is like a brother to me. The loaf I served at this meal is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evernote.com/shard/s228/sh/6009b71d-67c7-4719-b04d-1b0f7543365c/6a70a0ecfb13a7a7&quot;&gt;cheesy variation&lt;/a&gt; on the Whole Wheat Bread Recipe from King Arthur Flour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those aren’t Cheetos; they’re baby carrots that spent 20 minutes in a &lt;strong&gt;steamer&lt;/strong&gt;! With a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Digital-Steamer-37530A/dp/B00MA34AB0/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamilton Beach Steamer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a drizzle of olive oil, you can take a bag of cold baby carrots and turn them into a delicious, fiber-filled side dish. It is worth mentioning that this steamer’s primary directive is to steam frozen dumplings, which it does amazingly well!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s that easy! In 2016, you can really have it all: a fresh home-cooked meal with little work and – most importantly – very little opportunity for screwing up! Bom apetite!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I Sous Vide</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/12/how-i-sous-vide/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/12/how-i-sous-vide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sous vide is the &lt;del&gt;hot&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;cool&lt;/del&gt; warm new way to cook things. French for “under vacuum,” sous vide takes the guesswork out of cooking: simply grab the meat, vacuum seal it, throw it in a water bath, and wait. Give it some time and boom! Your meat is perfectly cooked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-12/sousvide.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few friends have asked about &lt;strong&gt;my setup&lt;/strong&gt;. I compiled my equipment in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/giftlist/2Y71VOG9O5OYJ&quot;&gt;Amazon gift list&lt;/a&gt;, which includes almost everything I use. The list looks (and is) long (and ultimately, expensive), but here are a few important points worth mentioning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To get started you really only need a &lt;strong&gt;circulator&lt;/strong&gt;. The circulator can be attached to any large pot you already have and you can seal your food inside regular Ziploc bags. The Modernist Cooking blog has a great post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazingfoodmadeeasy.com/info/modernist-cooking-blog/more/how-to-use-ziploc-bags-for-sous-vide&quot;&gt;how to get a nice seal using regular Ziploc bags&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;vacuum sealer&lt;/strong&gt; will let you get an excellent seal on anything you are putting in the water bath. I have the Waring Pro Pistol Sealer and have had no issues with it. While doing research for this post I discovered you can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlefoodgeek.com/2011/06/ziploc-vacuum-bags-vs-foodsaver-for-sous-vide-at-home/&quot;&gt;great vacuum seals&lt;/a&gt; for much cheaper using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UEMFUG&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ziploc Vaccum Starter Kit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can attach your circulator to a container or pot you already have, but a &lt;strong&gt;polycarbonate container with a lid&lt;/strong&gt; is better at retaining heat which helps your circulator keep the water at the perfect temperature. I used a Dremel tool to cut a circle in my lid so the circulator can be placed in and stays in place without the attachment accessory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can eat meat straight out of the water bath, but &lt;strong&gt;searing&lt;/strong&gt; gives your flabby piece of meat more flavor and a better texture profile. To sear, you can use a pan you already have.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For improved searing, get a &lt;strong&gt;cast-iron skillet&lt;/strong&gt; which can get hotter (and retain that hot temperature more easily) compared to an aluminum or stainless steel pan. You can put your cast-iron skillet in the oven at a very high temperature and then pull it out when you’re ready to sear the meat. At a very high temperature, you only need to sear each side of the steak for about 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To sear in style, get a &lt;strong&gt;torch&lt;/strong&gt;! To sear in the greatest of style, get the &lt;strong&gt;Searzall Torch attachment&lt;/strong&gt; which takes your torch game to the max! When searing with a torch, I lay the meat on &lt;strong&gt;cookie pan&lt;/strong&gt;. These pans can handle the heat, are lightweight, and are easy to clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I use &lt;strong&gt;tongs&lt;/strong&gt; to turn, flip, and move the meat. I avoid using forks because the first thing that breaks into the meat should be the diner’s utensils. A turner could work too, but that could get a bit hairy when you have heavy slabs of meat!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only thing missing from the Amazon gift list are the &lt;strong&gt;Propane Gas Cylinders&lt;/strong&gt; which I buy at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homedepot.com/p/Bernzomatic-1-lb-Camping-Gas-Cylinders-2-Pack-332773/205367341&quot;&gt;Home Depot&lt;/a&gt; because prices on Amazon are much higher due to increased shipping costs for flammable products.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The overall temperature of anything cooked by sous vide never gets really high (e.g. steaks in the water bath in the 130-140° F range). To avoid that cold food feeling, I recommend &lt;strong&gt;warming up (oven-safe) plates in the oven&lt;/strong&gt; prior to serving food. A few minutes in the oven around 170° F gets the plates nice and toasty and helps compensate for the low temperature cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there we have it! If you have any questions about sous vide or I’m missing out on some killer piece of hardware or some amazing technique &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;tweet at me&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Evernote Academy Insider Perspective</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/06/evernote-academy-perspective/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/06/evernote-academy-perspective</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Evernote was recently featured on a Glassdoor blog post titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/top-20-employee-benefits-perks/&quot;&gt;Top 20 Employee Benefits &amp;amp; Perks&lt;/a&gt;. Evernote got on this list because of &lt;strong&gt;Evernote Academy&lt;/strong&gt;: a range of courses offered to employees with some taught by employees themselves. Here’s an insider perspective on both leading and taking an Evernote Academy course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-06/academy.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernoters from USA, Japan, Korea, and China unite to learn Java and the Evernote SDK!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I was fortunate to work out of the Evernote Japan office for a few weeks. A few months ago, a member of our Japan team contacted me asking if I’d be interested in teaching a programming course centered around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.evernote.com/doc/&quot;&gt;Evernote SDK&lt;/a&gt; for employees without coding experience. It sounded like a fun time, so I agreed and the first ever &lt;strong&gt;international&lt;/strong&gt; Evernote Academy course was held; led from the USA by myself with participants from our Japan, Korea, and China offices. Over two one-hour courses, we covered the &lt;strong&gt;basics of Java&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/hello-java&quot;&gt;hello-java on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) (Android is Java-based, Java was my first language) and we developed a &lt;strong&gt;Java application&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/javanote&quot;&gt;javanote on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) that pulled currency conversion rates using &lt;a href=&quot;http://fixer.io&quot;&gt;fixer.io&lt;/a&gt; and created a note in Evernote with that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-06/source.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source code (heavily commented) is linked in the paragraph above!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the teaching experience very fulfilling. My goal was for fellow Evernoters participating to walk away with a basic understanding of how programming works, what an SDK is, and how SDKs can be used to extend services and glue together different services. All participants walked away with a better understanding of Java, the Evernote SDK, and SDKs in general. Naturally, the entire experience put everyone involved in contact with people within the Evernote organization that they may have never met. Many of us grew beyond being just a name and photo in the company directory. Evernote isn’t a huge company, but it’s large (and spread out around the world enough) that finding non-cheesy (e.g. icebreakers) ways to get new people working together is a challenge. Beyond the primary goal of providing employees with new knowledge and experiences, Evernote Academy has many beneficial side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-06/lockpicking.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule #1 of lock-picking: don't be a jerk and only pick your own locks!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both teaching and taking an Evernote course is a blast, except taking one involves way less preparation! Just in the past month, I’ve taken two awesome classes. One was a course on &lt;strong&gt;lock-picking&lt;/strong&gt; led by an Evernoter who is a hobbyist lock-picker! We learned the basics of lock-picking (e.g. the flaw in all locks that makes lock-picking possible), the legality of lock-picking (e.g. don’t be a jerk and only pick locks you own), and – of course – picked various locks that ranged in difficult from really easy to “your apartment lock difficult.” It was fun and something I would’ve never considered trying if it didn’t fall right in my lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-03-06/vertical.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buried deep down inside this engineer is an artist and a gardener.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the second class I took was on &lt;strong&gt;building a vertical succulent garden.&lt;/strong&gt; Ali, a designer on the team who is also a floral designer, led the course on building a little garden that you could hang on the wall or use as a centerpiece. She walked us through the basics of designing a succulent garden, how to build a vertical garden, and then we put that knowledge to use! If I can produce something that doesn’t look terrible (dare I say it looks good!?), you know you’ve got some quality instruction! Check out Ali’s awesome work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://alialbiani.com/floral/&quot;&gt;her website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m deep into my second year at Evernote and loving every minute of the ride. I love all the excellent food we get at Evernote… my increasing waistline does not. But Evernote Academy is quickly working its way up the ladder of things I love about working at Evernote. If you’re hungry for food or to learn new things, you’re in luck: Evernote is hiring! Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/careers/&quot;&gt;Careers&lt;/a&gt; page for open opportunities and satisfy that hunger!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Underscores in Java Numbers</title>
   <link href="/2016/02/20/underscores-in-java-numbers/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/02/20/underscores-in-java-numbers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/26/thats-allowed-in-java/&quot;&gt;variable shadowing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/12/try-catch-finally-blocks/&quot;&gt;catch-less try blocks&lt;/a&gt;, today we explore another cool little Java thing I learned about the other day: underscores in Java numeric literals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Declaring a few &quot;numbers&quot; with underscores to make them more readable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;oneMillion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_000_000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;creditCardNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1111&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_2222_3333_4444L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socialSecurityNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;111&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_222_3333L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike variable shadowing and catch-less try blocks, &lt;strong&gt;underscores in numeric literals makes things clearer and more readable&lt;/strong&gt; so I encourage using them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about this handy little language feature and see more examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/underscores-literals.html&quot;&gt;official Java documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>try-catch-finally blocks</title>
   <link href="/2016/02/12/try-catch-finally-blocks/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/02/12/try-catch-finally-blocks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s always pleasant to learn something new about a language you’ve been using for a while. Turns out when you declare a try block, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t need a catch block&lt;/strong&gt;. You ALWAYS need a catch OR a finally block, but the catch block is not required if you have a finally block. This is valid Java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;crashProneMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;badString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;badString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Clean up if needed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is practical usage of this? If you wanted your method to catch an exception but let the method caller handle it, you could skip catching and re-throwing the exception in your method. That looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Note that this method signature specifies that this method throws an Exception&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;crashProneMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;badString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This won't crash but the caller of crashProneMethod will&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// need to wrap the call to crashProneMethod in a try-catch &lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (or try-finally) block. This lets you &quot;catch&quot; the exception &lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// and throw it to the caller without having to manually call throw. &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;badString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Clean up if needed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a decently cool trick, but like &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/26/thats-allowed-in-java/&quot;&gt;variable shadowing in Java&lt;/a&gt;, it’s probably better to explicitly catch the exception and throw it because it makes your code more readable. But if you’re into exercising a language to make your code more difficult to read, try-finally away!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Base64 Into SharedPreferences</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Want to push and pull some &lt;strong&gt;Base64&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;SharedPreferences&lt;/strong&gt;? You’ll need to do some String to byte[] conversion to get it done. First, I (foolishly) tried using toString() on a byte[] but that won’t work! The String constructor saves the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Encoding&lt;/span&gt;

   <title>Evernote Hackathon Report</title>
   <link href="/2016/01/26/evernote-hackathon-report/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/01/26/evernote-hackathon-report</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernote’s first hackathon is complete!&lt;/strong&gt; Evernoters took the week to work on some really awesome projects. My project was pretty simple, but satisfied a critical need: building a system for people to quickly give feedback on their meal. Evernote has catering bring in delicious food for us to enjoy five days a week. When the facilities team tries out new caterers, they want to know what Evernoters think about the meals. This project allowed feedback to easily be given, collected, and reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-01-26/glatering.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showing off the finished product!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most things programming, bootstrapping is always the hugest pain. I settled on building a back-end service in Rails that allows the facilities team to input information on lunches, view information for all lunches on a sweet-looking dashboard, and a voting API for clients to call. Everything is driven from webpages, but we built a simple Android app to wrap the whole thing nicely. My Chief Design Officer, Justin, made everything look delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For having the most honorable project we won &lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mention&lt;/strong&gt; at the awards ceremony. There were a ton of amazing projects, including a bunch of awesome additions to the core Evernote product. I’m super excited to see these getting rolled in and released to Evernote customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2016-01-26/happy.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because we're happy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Star Wars - The Transition Trilogy</title>
   <link href="/2016/01/08/star-wars-the-transition-trilogy/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/01/08/star-wars-the-transition-trilogy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOILER ALERT:&lt;/strong&gt; Skip this post if you haven’t watched Star Wars: The Force Awakens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Star Wars episodes released – 4 through 6 – are collectively referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;original trilogy&lt;/strong&gt;. Episodes 1 through 3, which predate the events in the original trilogy, comprise the &lt;strong&gt;prequel trilogy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching The Force Awakens, I think we are in the midst of the &lt;strong&gt;transition trilogy&lt;/strong&gt;. The general theme of the transition trilogy? See old talent out the door as new talented is ushered in. Han kicked the bucket in episode 7. I predict Luke and Leia are in for unfortunate times in the next two episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transitions… They happen sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/strong&gt; In 2016, I’m making two resolutions: &lt;strong&gt;eat more pizza&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;automate things to make life simpler&lt;/strong&gt;. The former will be easy to commit to! I can eat pizza like no other and will continue to devour pizza this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is a little more difficult to define and execute. But it will have produce value over time. Technology has become great at sucking up everyone’s time. I want to turn that around and &lt;strong&gt;leverage technology to help me do things more easily and give me time back&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do this, 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Xenoblade Chronicles X Tips</title>
   <link href="/2015/12/20/xenoblade-x-tips/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/12/20/xenoblade-x-tips</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first time I sat down with Xenoblade Chronicles X, I felt – in the best way possible – totally overwhelmed. Having spent plenty of time with the game now, I’ve learned a lot along the way. The game doesn’t hold your hand very much so as I convince friends to take the dive into Mira, I decided to prepare a spoiler-free list of quick-start tips to help them get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the manual and watch the Survival Guide video series.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty daunting at 142 pages, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn03.nintendo-europe.com/media/downloads/games_8/emanuals/wii_u_6/xenoblade_chronicles_x/ElectronicManual_WiiU_XenobladeChroniclesX_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; has lots of useful information. I read it piece by piece while I was taking a break from the game. Also very useful are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtbEyrlD8PMV6b2NZsvl5b3pDzr4vQaOP&quot;&gt;survival guide videos&lt;/a&gt; by Nintendo. Except for the annoyingly (and unnecessarily) sassy narrator, the videos are very useful in getting you started on Mira. If you only want to do the bare minimum I recommend watching the Your New Home, Planetary Defense, and Mining Your Own Business videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn subtitles on.&lt;/strong&gt; This game unfortunately suffers from some questionable sound design decisions. Songs with lyrics play during scenes where characters are conversing and even worse, the audio is terribly balanced which results in characters’ words getting drowned out in the background song. Turn on subtitles and read your way through this flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early on feel free to explore and plant data probes.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t feel like you need to rush through the story missions. Most story missions require you to explore a certain percentage of Mira so running around and planting data probes early on is &lt;del&gt;required&lt;/del&gt; encouraged. Exploring will also open up fast-travel points so you can move around more efficiently later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re aiming for 100% completion, do not fret – there are no missables that count towards completion.&lt;/strong&gt; There are some heart-to-heart conversations for one particular character that are missable, but they do not count towards completion. I would avoid looking up which character this is as it may spoil some of the story for you. In short, do your thing without fear of missing out on 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probes are not lost when you swap them.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if you are swapping a Research Probe on a particular site for a Mining Probe, the Research Probe will be returned to your inventory. You still need to pay a placement fee each time you place a probe so it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. &lt;strong&gt;Revenue also increases on sites with discovered sight-seeing spots.&lt;/strong&gt; If a site has a sight-seeing spot in its range you will see something like “Sightseeing Spots Found 0/2” when you click on the data probe site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t stress about picking your BLADE division&lt;/strong&gt; as you can easily change it later. Different actions like collecting items, hunting indigens, and planting data probes will gain you BLADE experience points which will level up your standing – your BLADE level – in organization. Different divisions give more or less points for these actions depending on what that division’s main goal is. For example, Curators who are tasked with collecting materials get more points for collecting items compared to Pathfinders who are charged with discovering locations and planting data probes. You can read more about the different divisions spoiler-free on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xenoblade.wikia.com/wiki/Division&quot;&gt;Xenoblade Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend going with the Curators because you’ll always be collecting a ton of items while roaming Mira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When your BLADE level increases, talk to Eleonora at the BLADE Concourse&lt;/strong&gt; in the Administrative District – next to where you get missions – to level up your field skills. There are three field skills: Mechanical, Archaeological, and Biological. Planting data probes is dependent on your Mechanical level so I recommend leveling that up to level 4 first and then leveling up the other two skills. Note that opening a treasure depends on the field skill corresponding to the type of treasure so you won’t be able to open Archaeological or Biological treasures over level 1, but that’s okay; just come back for them later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shadowrunner arte can give you stealth outside of battle.&lt;/strong&gt; This is extremely helpful if you’re trying to open a treasure or plant a data probe guarded by a powerful enemy. The Commando class learns this arte, but you don’t need to go this class route to have access to it as Elma learns it. Read more about this on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/3wmyqw/psa_the_art_shadowrunner_from_the_commando_class/&quot;&gt;reddit post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allocated Battle Points (BP) cannot be reset but you can keep farming more.&lt;/strong&gt; BP is used to upgrade artes and skills to make them more powerful. As you gain new artes and skills or change your class you will likely swap out artes and skills. Don’t sweat it if you’re removing an upgraded arte or skill because you can just keep getting BP. Also, upgrading to level 3 is relatively cheap compared to the level 4 and 5 (max level) upgrades so don’t hesitate to upgrade to at least level 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a class that interests you and change it once you max that class out.&lt;/strong&gt; You start out as a Drifter which is a generic class. Once you max (i.e. level 10) this freelancer class out, you can pick a more specialized branch to pursue. Different branches have access to different weapons like assault rifles, longswords, photon sabers, ray-guns. When you master the end of a class branch, you’ll have access to the weapons for that class using ANY other class. For example, once you master the Astral Crusader class you can use a Sniper Rifle and Javelin and all their related artes paired with any other class. In short, you will likely max out at least two or three classes during the game so don’t worry too much about picking a class early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters who join your party cannot change their class.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the main character who can change classes and maxes out these classes at level 10, characters with a fixed class max that class out at level 20. Note that you’re still responsible for setting and upgrading their artes and skills and outfitting them with better gear. Also, characters that join later on will have all the BP you have gathered thus far so you shouldn’t feel rushed to recruit all characters immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill in the Collectopaedia for rewards.&lt;/strong&gt; Items collected while exploring Mira can be registered in the Collectopaedia which can be accessed from Intel in the main menu. Be aware that registering an item consumes one of that item. But filling in the Collectopaedia will not only satisfy your inner completionist, you’ll also gain rewards like Battle Points along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! This list turned out a lot longer than I had intended. But it’s to be expected as Xenoblade Chronicles X is massive. If I’m missing something really important feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me an tweet&lt;/a&gt; or a message on &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/u/marktronic&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;! Happy exploring!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Xenoblade Chronicles X Has Landed</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s finally here! After waiting for what’s seemed like an eternity – from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GxUMMGyZcM&quot;&gt;reveal trailer&lt;/a&gt; in early 2013 – &lt;strong&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles X&lt;/strong&gt; for the Wii U has finally landed on North American shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-12-04/oblivia.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screenshot by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/3we3hd/this_games_visuals_never_cease_to_amaze_me_if/cxvm63d&quot;&gt;/u/AvatarTuner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put a few hours into the game and there is one word that describes how I feel right now: &lt;strong&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s not that bad, suffocating overwhelmed feeling; it’s a pleasantly-smothering eagerness to take on a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-12-04/primordia.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew the open world in this game was huge, but the amount of things to do and game mechanics to explore are equally large in scale. I’m beyond excited to dive in and explore the world of Mira! Christmas has certainly come early for me this year for me!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Online Money Security</title>
   <link href="/2015/11/20/online-money-security/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/11/20/online-money-security</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My parents aren’t super comfortable with technology. They didn’t grow up with computers and they still don’t use them that much. My mom only recently got a smartphone and – besides typical phone stuff – only uses Facebook. It still blows their minds how much we can do online. From the comfort of home we can see pictures from around the world, deposit checks, check the detailed history of a bank account, check their retirement plans and Social Security benefits, send other people money, and see lots of pictures of cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-11-20/cmoney.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is money safe in the cloud!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their unfamiliarity with technology they do have one very legitimate concern that comes up frequently whenever financial matters are involved: is this safe? The answer: &lt;strong&gt;it depends&lt;/strong&gt;. Threats are constantly evolving, but you can take steps to keep yourself protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice good basic computer security.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve written about how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.gg/2015/09/22/computer-security-basics/&quot;&gt;improve your computer security&lt;/a&gt;. Those are helpful here, specifically the tips on passwords and two-factor authentication which basically boil down to don’t reuse passwords and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register for an account with the IRS and Social Security Administration (SSA).&lt;/strong&gt; This is a clear case against the argument “if I don’t create an account, I’m safe.” Why these two accounts in particular? A fraudster can create accounts in your name and then file tax returns with the IRS and claim your benefits with the SSA. To add to this trouble privacy regulations (intended to protect you) will protect the fraudsters instead! Unfortunately this is not unfounded fear-mongering. Security expert Brian Krebs &lt;a href=&quot;http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/03/sign-up-at-irs-gov-before-crooks-do-it-for-you/&quot;&gt;wrote about a victim&lt;/a&gt; who had an IRS account created by fraudsters and the subsequent harrowing experience. &lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: The IRS has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Statement-on-the-Get-Transcript-Application&quot;&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; creating online accounts in light of the unauthorized fraudulent activity described in the post by Krebs. So for now, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.ssa.gov/RIL/SiView.do&quot;&gt;sign up for an account with the SSA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep an eye on your credit with CreditKarma.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s good to keep an eye on your credit report. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com/&quot;&gt;CreditKarma&lt;/a&gt; is an easy (and free) way to keep tabs on your credit. If someone opens a credit card in your name, you want to know as soon as possible. CreditKarma will email you if it finds a new account listed on your credit report. CreditKarma will also give you your credit score, which is a great to know given its large impact on interest rates of loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregate all your finances with Mint.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mint.com/&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; makes tracking your bank accounts, credit cards, investment accounts, and loans simple by putting all that information in one place. I think asking someone to log into multiple websites to verify everything looks good is a harder sell than asking them to check everything in a single place. Mint also gives you an ever useful high-level view of your financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up a firewall checking account.&lt;/strong&gt; We share and use our checking account information for all sorts of things like PayPal, Venmo, electronic rent payment, and online credit card payments to name a few. A firewall checking account is an account that you connect all these external services (also potential attack vectors) to. You keep only the amount you need in this account so in case of a compromise, you don’t lose access to much money. Behind the firewall account, you can safely keep the rest of your money in other accounts that are not externally exposed. You can read more about firewall checking accounts on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mymoneyblog.com/setting-up-buffer-firewall-bank-accounts.html&quot;&gt;MyMoneyBlog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that gets you feeling more comfortable about money matters online. If I got something terribly wrong or somehow offended you, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me an angry tweet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Data Plans, Mysterious Fruits, and Ice Cream!</title>
   <link href="/2015/11/09/verizon-data-plans/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/11/09/verizon-data-plans</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past August, Verizon reworked their wireless data plan offerings. Here’s how they sold them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px solid #555555;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-11-09/before.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What fruit is used for the 3 GB plan? My best guess is a hairless coconut. Also, why does this mysterious fruit not cast a shadow like the other fruits?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “Best for” cases will only confuse customers. What does it mean to use “Facebook once in a while?” Am I a “gamer” needing extra data if all I play is offline games? And then there’s the stupid obvious: of course “big-time data users” pick the beefiest plan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are the leaves of the pineapple clipped on top!?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fruit analogy is a bit forced. Yes, a watermelon is heavier than an orange. But fruits have varying prices per pound. For example, take a watermelon and a weight-equivalent amount of avocados; the avocados will cost more. You’re literally comparing apples to oranges, but the apples are watermelons in this case. That said, if you overanalyze everything, everything is a bit forced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a screenshot of this and months later finally sat down to write this post. Fortunately, revisiting this page today I saw Verizon made many positive tweaks to this page!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px solid #555555;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-11-09/after.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone knows this absolute truth: ice cream is one of the best things ever. Fruit is nice, but ice cream is infinitely better. For the record, if the new version had used vegetables, I’d lose it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My guess at the flavors: Strawberry, French Vanilla, Matcha Green Tea, Blueberry, and Vanilla Bean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The header changed from “One plan. Four sizes.” to “One plan. Pick a size.” Adding a call to action helps guide users to the ultimate goal: helping them pick a data plan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using scoops of ice cream to differentiate plans is simple and natural. More scoops means you get more ice cream, but you’ll pay more. Everyone’s gone through this experience (some more than others) when buying ice cream.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scoops are also just more aesthetically pleasing. They are coherent. A single scoop of Strawberry next to a double scoop of Strawberry and Vanilla will always look more natural versus a watermelon sitting next to a pineapple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “Best for” in the original version was a brave, but foolish endeavor. Removing it completely was a good move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some people will always go with the most expensive option and Verizon loses nothing someone uses 1 GB of the 18 GB XXL plan. Adding an XXL option will impact revenue in positive ways.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t like chocolate, but most people love chocolate. Is there a kindred chocolate-hater on the Verizon team that refused to add a scoop of chocolate to even their 5-scoop XXL cone!?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As scoops are added across plans, the new scoops somehow magically get added UNDER the previous scoop. See how 1 GB is a scoop of Strawberry, but 3 GB has a scoop of French Vanilla UNDER (and not OVER) the scoop of Strawberry? It’s a bit unnatural and quite unnerving for this ice cream lover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: I thought the fruity implementation was a bad joke, but I’m actually quite fond of and impressed with the ice cream implementation. It works well. Kudos to the Verizon design team!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Google Calendar and Mortality</title>
   <link href="/2015/11/02/google-calendar-and-mortality/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/11/02/google-calendar-and-mortality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do seemingly random things ever hit unexpected places in unexpected ways?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Birthday calendar that I use to keep track of family and friend’s birthdays. It’s reliable because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Birthdays don’t (normally) change!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have to rely on some social network (and proper privacy settings) to inform me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can add reminders days or weeks ahead of particular birthdays in case I need to get a gift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding someone’s birthday to my calendar is easy. You create a new event and set it to repeat annually. And then the unexpected part happens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #555555;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-11-02/repeating.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I go with the DENIAL route and pick NEVER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! Google Calendar just reminded me of a sobering and morbid truth: &lt;strong&gt;everyone dies&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks for that! And double thanks for reminding me of that when I’m thinking about people important enough to be added to my special Birthday calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #555555;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-11-02/feels.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This calendar hit me right in the feels!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling down? Turn that frown around! It’s Monday! Happy Monday! Be happy please! Come on!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/2015/10/14/madhouse-anime</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I start watching an anime series and it’s so good, I power through it in a few days. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.funimation.com/shows/overlord/home&quot;&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; is the most recent anime to hook me so thoroughly I blasted through all 13 episodes in a weekend. While I could sing praises for Overlord, the very clear trend I only recently became aware of is the studio behind Overlord: &lt;strong&gt;Madhouse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say &lt;strong&gt;Madhouse&lt;/strong&gt; has absolutely and consistently been &lt;strong&gt;killing it&lt;/strong&gt;, producing top quality anime feels like an understatement. Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_(company)#Works&quot;&gt;list of works by Madhouse&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll find anime that are, should be, or will soon be on your favorites list. This list includes gems like Death Note, No Game No Life, Death Parade, Parasyte, Monster, Hellsing Ultimate, Black Lagoon, Hunter x Hunter, and Trigun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a new anime to watch? Take a somewhat unconventional route and start looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_(company)#Works&quot;&gt;the Madhouse productions&lt;/a&gt; you haven’t watched. Happy Madhousing!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hello Tabletop Gaming</title>
   <link href="/2015/10/04/hello-tabletop-gaming/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/10/04/hello-tabletop-gaming</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently begun exploring &lt;strong&gt;tabletop gaming&lt;/strong&gt; and I’m happy to report my journey so far has been thoroughly enjoyable! Here are two games (one board and one card) that I’m currently hooked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-10-04/pandemic.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our first victory over Pandemic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; is a cooperative board game (2-4 players) that pits your team against four malevolent diseases, which are conveniently named red, blue, yellow, and black. Players take turns moving between cities and trying to stymie the spread of the various diseases while gathering enough resources to discover respective cures. Discussion among the team is encouraged and a must for victory as coordination is key. It’s a challenging game; it took us four tries to finally win a game! Mechanics in the game make each iteration feel novel and fresh: each person is randomly assigned a role that gives them special perks (e.g. a medic can cure diseases in a town faster) and how diseases spread are determined from a shuffled (random) deck of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several expansions to &lt;strong&gt;Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; that increase the challenge in this already challenging game. If this sounds daunting, I still definitely recommend getting the &lt;strong&gt;On The Brink&lt;/strong&gt; expansion from the get-go as it includes much-needed dishes and trays for organizing all the tokens and disease cubes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Z-Man-Games-ZMG-71100-Pandemic/dp/B00A2HD40E&quot;&gt;Pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CAG5LJ2/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1444003506&quot;&gt;On The Brink&lt;/a&gt; will run you about $50, but I’ve found it a worthwhile investment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-10-04/monopoly.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end of a Monopoly Deal game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopoly Deal&lt;/strong&gt; is a faster way to play Monopoly. You’ll acquire property, charge rent, put houses and hotels down, screw over friends, and probably lose friends. But it won’t take more than 15 minutes to accomplish all this and all you need to carry around is a deck of 110 cards! You win when you can acquire three complete sets of a property color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with regular Monopoly, your &lt;del&gt;friends&lt;/del&gt; mortal enemies will be looking to deplete your bank, take your property, and inflict permanent damage to your soul. Luck is certainly useful when drawing cards from a shuffled deck. But I’ve also lost consistently enough times that some strategy (that I’m unaware of) must be at play! Purchasable today for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-B0965-Monopoly-Deal-Card/dp/B00NQQTZCO&quot;&gt;under $5&lt;/a&gt;, getting this game won’t break the bank!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’ve piqued your interest, but you’ve got any questions feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Computer Security Basics</title>
   <link href="/2015/09/22/computer-security-basics/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/09/22/computer-security-basics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our rapidly technologizing world, staying secure means adapting to novel threats. Staying safe isn’t difficult. A little effort here and there will keep you out of a lot of trouble. Here are some basic computer security tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passwords&lt;/strong&gt; - Most people are terrible about passwords: using just a single password for everything. This is bad. When you hear about a website getting hacked, and passwords getting leaked your first thought should not be, “Crap! What other sites was I using that password on?” It should be, “Oh… I guess I need to update my password on that one site.” You need unique passwords for everything. Don’t share passwords unless you are okay with someone getting into that service. The unique password lifestyle isn’t as hard as it sounds. There are plenty of password managers that make staying secure easy. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; - Two-factor means you need two things to log onto a particular service. You are probably already familiar with one-factor authentication when a service just asks you for your password. Two-factor requires another form of verification. Usually this is a code sent via SMS to your phone or a code generated on your phone with an app like Google Authenticator. For any critical services (anything involving access to your email or money) it’s important to set up two-factor authentication. This makes accessing your account more difficult for adversaries and isn’t as big an inconvenience as some people make it out to be. For most services, you are allowed to flag a device as personal. Once flagged, it won’t ask for a code again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back up your data&lt;/strong&gt; - Devices break, devices get stolen, and sometimes you accidentally delete important files. Keeping your data safe is important and it’s something that’s often overlooked because you don’t really see the value of your data until it’s long gone. The cost of backing up your data is chump change compared to the cost of attempting to recover data from a bad hard drive or the mental anguish suffered if a thief makes off with your computer. I wrote a whole post about backing up, aptly named &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.gg/2014/01/24/back-it-up/&quot;&gt;Back It Up&lt;/a&gt;. For the impatient: just get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.code42.com/crashplan/&quot;&gt;CrashPlan&lt;/a&gt; and let it automagically back everything up for you to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your computer up-to-date&lt;/strong&gt; - Is your computer nagging you to install some updates? Go ahead and let it do it’s thing, especially if they mention security in them. Keeping your computer updated leaves you less vulnerable to all the bad stuff out there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable Click-to-Play in your browser&lt;/strong&gt; - Most web browsers load all content when you visit a page. A page can include content that requires a plug-in like Flash or Silverlight to run. If these plug-ins have some vulnerability, malware can silently target those vulnerabilities. If you see an update for Java, Adobe Reader, Quicktime, Silverlight or Flash install them ASAP! This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser/&quot;&gt;How to Geek article&lt;/a&gt; explains how to set up click-to-play on the more popular web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is certainly not an exhaustive list, but it’s a decent start to protecting yourself. Did I get something totally wrong or something super important is missing here? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;Send me a tweet!&lt;/a&gt; Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Better Safe Than Sorry UX</title>
   <link href="/2015/09/06/better-safe-than-sorry-ux/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/09/06/better-safe-than-sorry-ux</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I previously wrote about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.gg/2014/11/18/finish-the-flow/&quot;&gt;Instagram “report user” user experience&lt;/a&gt;, which I felt left users hanging at the end. I noticed the problematic part of the flow has recently been changed! But I’m unsure how I feel about the changes. Here’s the new “report user” flow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-09-06/donedone3.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONE and DONE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out that last frame where you are thanked for reporting the offending user. Before, if you reported someone Instagram made you hit “Cancel” to dismiss the confirmation but now it gives you &lt;strong&gt;TWO&lt;/strong&gt; “DONE” buttons. This new UX paradigm which I dub &lt;strong&gt;Better Safe Than Sorry UX - let’s just put the button twice to ensure users get it&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty innovative, certainly strange, and questionably provides a good user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips for Aspiring Programmers</title>
   <link href="/2015/08/04/tips-for-aspiring-programmers/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/08/04/tips-for-aspiring-programmers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every so often I have friends ask me to talk to the someone who is interested in computers and programming. I’m always eager to run my mouth so I, naturally, always jump on the opportunity. But after telling the same story multiple times I figured it’d be more efficient to just write down my definitive &lt;strong&gt;TIPS FOR ASPIRING PROGRAMMERS&lt;/strong&gt; here and just share this instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s never too late to start.&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t need to decide to become a programmer early in life. A lot of people don’t even study computer science in college and just pick up programming on their own. Some people don’t even go to college, although I highly recommend college as it was a great academic and personal learning experience. I have worked with many talented people who have taken many different paths to becoming strong programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 20px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-08-04/pl.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So many programming languages to choose from!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t get hung up on picking your first language.&lt;/strong&gt; Lots of people are intimidated by how expansive the programming world is. You can program for micro-chips, phones, computers, servers, and even networks composed of many computers. The number of programming languages out there is also ridiculous. But don’t get bogged down by all the options you have. Just pick a language and go with it. The first language I learned was Java and I think it’s still a decent first language to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 20px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-08-04/kadenze.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to learn about programming and computer music, check out this course&lt;br /&gt;on Kadenze taught by some of my (very, very) smart friends!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are lots of free, online resources to get you started.&lt;/strong&gt; But where do you start? Fortunately there are tons of great and free resources available online. With the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) available on sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.com&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kadenze.com&quot;&gt;Kadenze&lt;/a&gt;, you can sit in (i.e. watch videos) of real college courses from the comfort of your home. Watch the videos, do the homework assignments, and you’ll be pumping out code in no time. If you require more structure see if there is a local college that offers introductory programming courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 20px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-08-04/tsp.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the optimal route for the Traveling Salesman is trickier than it seems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build something, even if it’s small and inconsequential.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you’re comfortable with a programming language, try building something! It doesn’t need to change the world. Just pick a problem and solve it. Out of ideas and into space? I really enjoyed working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos126/assignments/nbody.html&quot;&gt;N-body Simulations&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos126/assignments/tsp.html&quot;&gt;Traveling Salesman Problem&lt;/a&gt; during my first college computer science course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 20px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-08-04/gitgithub.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git + GitHub = A match made in heaven.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn to use version control early.&lt;/strong&gt; Version control lets you do work and “commit” progress. Committing basically is like a save point for your work; if you do something terrible after making a commit, you can easily see what you did since that commit and undo it if necessary. It also makes working with multiple people on a project (the norm in most projects) much easier. I only started using version control when I started working, but wish I had done so from the get-go. It lets you do work and get to a good point, save that point, and continue working. It reinforces good behavior in programming: build out things incrementally and make sure they work before moving on. Like programming languages there are many version control systems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; are pretty popular right now; git is the system used to version control your code and GitHub is where you can remotely host your code and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 20px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-08-04/xcode.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xcode sucks, but it'll only run on a Mac!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re getting a computer to program, just get a Mac.&lt;/strong&gt; This is definitely just my opinion because I know a lot of people are very sensitive over this issue. I grew up on Windows and switched over to Macs in college. I’ve used a few flavors of Linux in college. When it comes to finding the sweet spot between user-friendliness, usability, and “ease of jumping into programming” Macs leave Windows and Linux in the dust. Also, if you’re planning on programming for iOS or Macs, you’ll definitely need a Mac. For what it’s worth, the vast, vast, vast majority of engineers I’ve met in the Bay Area use Macs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 20px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-08-04/jekyll.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This blog is powered by Jekyll which is a program itself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a blog and just write!&lt;/strong&gt;  I think writing is great for reflection and growth. Maybe you had a lot of trouble figuring out how to do X but searched around and found A, B, C solutions and decided to go with C because of this and that reason. Writing is a great skill to have. I found once you start working as a programmer, you’ll spend most of your time just writing code. That said, being able to effectively put your thoughts in writing will make you a better communicator and engineering is not only about writing code. Another benefit of having a blog is it increases your visibility. If an employer is Googling you (pretty common - I do it for interview candidates just to see what pops up), it’s good to be out there and have a voice. You don’t need to write exclusively about technical stuff. Write about things you care about. I write not only about technical stuff, but also random things that interest me (food, video games, etc). In short, writing will help you more effectively learn and grow as a programmer and put a more human face to you when you are sending your resume around town for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go! It’s a lot, but I hope it helps you get started if you’re interested in programming. If you have any more questions feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Screw Command-Line Interface Elitism</title>
   <link href="/2015/07/28/screw-command-line-interface-elitism/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/07/28/screw-command-line-interface-elitism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;style media=&quot;screen&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;

margin-top: 10px;

margin-left: 50px;
padding-left: 15px;
border-left: 2px solid #ccc;
}

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read a post by Chris Beams on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/&quot;&gt;How to Write a Git Commit Message&lt;/a&gt;. Before I get into it, I want to emphasize that this post isn’t about hating on Chris or his advice; they’re both awesome. ♥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is about something I noticed in Chris’ post and something I hear come up way too often in the programming world: how amazing the command-line interface (CLI) is and how everyone should be using it as exclusively as possible because &lt;strong&gt;it’s the best thing ever&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of Chris’ post, we are left with some helpful tips to be the best git-people that no one ever was. One tip focuses on the importance of using git on the CLI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Learn to love the command line. Leave the IDE behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For as many reasons as there are git subcommands, it's wise to embrace the command line. Git is insanely powerful; IDEs are too, but each in different ways. I use an IDE every day (IntelliJ IDEA) and have used others extensively (Eclipse), but I have never seen IDE integration for git that could begin to match the ease and power of the command line (once you know it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Certain git-related IDE functions are invaluable, like calling git rm when you delete a file, and doing the right stuff with git when you rename one. Where everything falls apart is when you start trying to commit, merge, rebase, or do sophisticated history analysis through the IDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

When it comes to wielding the full power of git, it's command-line all the way.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what I think? &lt;strong&gt;SCREW COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE ELITISM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I use git on both the command-line and with my preferred git GUI of choice: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.git-tower.com/&quot;&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt;. I like to do certain things in Tower (review commits, stage individual files, write commit messages) and I like to do other things on the CLI (interactive rebases, fetches, resolving merge conflicts, pushes). It works well for me. I am comfortable and capable with my workflow, and I’m pretty fast at getting from point A to point B in the git world, even though I am not going “command-line all the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-07-28/harmony.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can all live in HARMONY!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone getting started with git I always tell them about my own workflow. They’ll learn about how you can use both GUIs and CLI, which is more than enough to get them going. If they have any questions down the road, I’ll also already be familiar with their setup. :) I don’t feel like I’m setting them up for failure by encouraging using a GUI but rather just showing them that there are many ways to get git done. Becoming comfortable and good at anything is a process and it should be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this whole “CLI or bust” attitude is really silly. Writing a blog post about it &lt;del&gt;is definitely&lt;/del&gt; may be even sillier…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I also can’t stand bad commit messages so if you haven’t already, go read &lt;a href=&quot;http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/&quot;&gt;Chris’ post&lt;/a&gt; now!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Useful Utilities - Paste Typer</title>
   <link href="/2015/07/18/useful-utilities-paste-typer/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/07/18/useful-utilities-paste-typer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want to paste. And &lt;strong&gt;sometimes you can’t paste&lt;/strong&gt;. Right-clicks are ignored. Command/Control + V is also ignored. Sadness ensues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, here are some of those annoying times you can’t just paste:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entering passwords when creating and opening an encrypted disk image.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Websites that (stupidly) prevent you from pasting passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pasting text copied from outside a Genymotion emulator into the emulator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Logging into certain apps like Google Drive on Mac while setting them up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of AppleScripts and applets that promise to simulate typing what’s on your clipboard to get around this issue. My favorite is &lt;strong&gt;Paste Typer&lt;/strong&gt;.

   <title>Olá Francesinha!</title>
   <link href="/2015/07/10/a-francesinha/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/07/10/a-francesinha</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been five years since I was last in Portugal. One thing I was excited about (besides seeing family) was eating a &lt;strong&gt;francesinha&lt;/strong&gt;: the ultimate sandwich. This is a francesinha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-07-10/dna.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesinha from Café DNA (Vila de Arcos de Valdevez)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like a sandwich on a plate covered in sauce. &lt;strong&gt;But it’s way more than that!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sandwich&lt;/strong&gt; contains all sorts of meats including steak, ham, smoked pork sausage (linguiça), fresh sausage (chipolata), and maybe some other meats depending on where you get it. It’s topped off with a ton of queijo (cheese), an ovo estrelado (fried egg), and a side of batata frita (fries). Your arteries deserve to be clogged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sandwich is imposing, but it’s really the &lt;strong&gt;molho (sauce)&lt;/strong&gt; that makes the francesinha special. Recipes are well-kept secrets but the common ingredient in them all is &lt;strong&gt;cerveja (beer)&lt;/strong&gt;. It varies from place to place and the sauce is usually what people will argue about when discussing their favorite francesinha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sauce varies from place to place, but the entire dish is sometimes reimagined. The Portuguese no longer explore the seas. Instead, they &lt;strong&gt;search for culinary paradise&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://restaurantesmauritania.com/index.php/mauritaniagrill&quot;&gt;Mauritânia Grill&lt;/a&gt; in Leça de Palmeira, Porto (the hometown of the francesinha) you can get a francesinha that comes loaded with a ton of seafood like shrimp, prawns, mussels, barnacles, clams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-07-10/porto.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesinha Artilhada from Mauritânia Grill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll miss you so much francesinha. Até já (until we meet again)!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The day will be &lt;strong&gt;December 4th, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;. The sadness of not knowing when &lt;strong&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles X&lt;/strong&gt; is coming to North America is over. It has been replaced by both sadness and anticipation that it’s a little under half a year away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of exciting announcements at this year’s E3, but a release date out of the Nintendo and Monolith Soft camp is all I wanted. We even got another trailer that features those iconic Hiroyuki Sawano-esque vocals right when you have robots epically gliding over water!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pro Bash Profiling</title>
   <link href="/2015/06/10/pro-bash-profiling/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/06/10/pro-bash-profiling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Bash profile is critical to keeping me &lt;strong&gt;elite&lt;/strong&gt; on the command-line. Keeping myself elite across multiple computers is also very easy with Dropbox (or your file syncing service du jour). Then I create a very, very simple .bash_profile that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;~ cat .bash_profile

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/Dropbox/Bash/main.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This grabs the contents of main.sh from a folder in my Dropbox and effectively puts it in the .bash_profile file. What does main.sh look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;~ cat ~/Dropbox/Bash/main.sh 

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Git Power Up!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/Dropbox/Bash/git-completion.sh

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Android&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/Dropbox/Bash/android.sh

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Evernote&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/Dropbox/Bash/evernote.sh

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The rest including everything and the kitchen sink...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I separate things out a little more to keep things modular and keep similar functionality together, which makes everything a little easier to both maintain and read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t update these files very often, but anytime I do, it’ll get synced automagically. The sad days of typing a new alias on a computer and seeing “command not found” are gone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Came here looking for awesome Bash profile aliases? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/&quot;&gt;Nate Landau’s extremely OP Bash profile&lt;/a&gt; for some excellent Bash profiling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Bash profiling!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Running in Japan</title>
   <link href="/2015/06/08/running-in-japan/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/06/08/running-in-japan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m heading home today. I did and saw a lot in Japan. One thing I’m really happy I did in Japan was &lt;strong&gt;run&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-06-08/japan-run.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A run around The Imperial Palace in Tokyo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running in the morning was a great way to start my days and do a bit of &lt;strong&gt;drive-by sight-seeing&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only did running make me feel less terrible about all the food and beer I was consuming, it let me get lost in a new place. Each morning, I’d pick a direction or landmark and run. If I saw something cool I’d take a break, snap a picture, and get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-06-08/zojo.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sights to see! Zōjō-ji and Tokyo Tower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 80+ miles (humblebrag) logged of running in Japan, here are some tips on running in Japan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Tokyo, run around parks or The Imperial Palace so you can avoid intersections where you may need to wait a while.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid running inside parks because it’s usually not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to bow while running. When running past police officers, I sometimes did a running bow and greeted them. I think they appreciated it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring a camera! You probably are already using a running app to track your run so you already have a camera on you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Kyoto, the Kamo River cuts the city in half. The path along the river is great for running.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring a data-connected phone because you will likely get lost. Google Maps will make sure your 8 mile run doesn’t end 8 miles from where you’re staying!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re running during rush hours, avoid major train stations and streets since they’ll be filled with people walking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t expect to set any records. I was stopping frequently to snap photos of all the nice scenes I was running past.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tokyo is big. If you want to be somewhere centrally located, check out Akasaka. From there you have a lot of directions to branch out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop by a French bakery in a train station after your run and deliciously undo your one hour run in five minutes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy running wherever you are!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Japan is Cool, But...</title>
   <link href="/2015/06/04/japan-is-cool-but/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/06/04/japan-is-cool-but</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My month-long excursion to Japan is winding down. It’s been a blast! Japan is a great country filled with wonderfully awesome people, wonderfully clean toilets, and wonderfully delicious food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-06-04/oko.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan is so beautiful...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I told everyone everything is all sunshine and rainbows here, people would be a bit skeptical of my assessment so here’s a &lt;strong&gt;very serious&lt;/strong&gt; list of things that &lt;del&gt;slightly irk&lt;/del&gt; absolutely infuriate me about Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WASTED PACKAGING&lt;/strong&gt; - Man, Japanese people LOVE packaging. Bought a piece of bread? It’ll get put in a little plastic bag and then that will get put in a bigger plastic bag. Bought a small jar of pickled sakura? Let me wrap it in fancy wrapping paper and then put it in a small plastic bag and then put that bag in another plastic bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO TRASH CANS&lt;/strong&gt; - This makes how ridiculously clean Japan is even more amazing. There are so few trash cans anywhere so I found myself carrying my trash around with me until I found a convenience store. Even the places I was staying at only had very small trash cans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CASH-LOVING COUNTRY&lt;/strong&gt; - For a country that is be such a technological powerhouse, it’s a freaking shame I had to carry cash around with me all the time because most places just take cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BICYCLES ON SIDEWALKS&lt;/strong&gt; - I think the sidewalks of Tokyo get more traffic than the streets do. You’d figure bicyclists would share the streets with cars, but no – bicyclists ride on already-crowded sidewalks. And if a bicyclist gets stuck behind you behind you, don’t expect them to act like Bay Area bicyclist snobs and announce their holier-than-thou presence so you can move; they’ll just quietly roll behind you until a space opens up for them to ride past you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAINS GO TO SLEEP&lt;/strong&gt; - The Japanese rail system is ridiculously awesome. Trains are always on time and come so often that missing a train isn’t so bad. You only need to wait a few minutes before the next one comes. But between 1 AM and 5 AM the trains stop running completely and this is kind of disappointing. Then again, this encourages karaoking all night and taking the 5 AM train home… Not so bad after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AVOID ROPPONGI&lt;/strong&gt; - My only actual negative experience in Japan was when I decided to go have dinner with a friend in Roppongi on Friday night. Roppongi is known for having an active nightlife. But we were just harassed persistently during our search for a place to eat by sleazy promoters promising us beer, women, and good times. First of all, that sounds way too good to be true so there must be some trickery at the end where you take all my money. Second, leave me alone – I want to eat some ramen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ESCALATOR ETHICS STANDARDIZATION&lt;/strong&gt; - Everything is switched in Japan. People drive on the left, drivers sit on the right, and people standing on the escalator instead of walking on it stand on the left so walkers can pass on the right. These escalator ethics apply everywhere except – as far as I know – to Osaka and some random station in Tokyo. Standardize please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHINJUKU STATION IS TOO BIG&lt;/strong&gt; - Seriously, this train station, which is the busiest transit hub in the world, is freaking huge. If Google Maps tells you you need to go to one of Shinjuku’s 36 (!!) train platforms, add a little buffer window to your expected travel time because you may be walking a long time in this behemoth. Also, if you’re on one side of Shinjuku station and you need to be on the opposite side, good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Japan. For being awesome, but also having these &lt;del&gt;so very minor&lt;/del&gt; incredibly disturbing flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>All Hail the Angel Soft!</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/20/angel-soft/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/20/angel-soft</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During my visit to South Korea in 2013, I discovered the Korean bakery Tous les Jours and their wonderfully amazing THE+ Milk Bread. But I think I found a new pastry to claim the title of &lt;strong&gt;Mark’s Favorite Baked Thing&lt;/strong&gt;! How did this fortuitous discovery happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, visit one of the 255 &lt;strong&gt;Vie de France&lt;/strong&gt; cafés in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/vie-de-france.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vie de France at Tameikesanno Station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you enter, bask in the wonderful aroma of baked goods… And pray to the Baked Good Gods that they have &lt;strong&gt;Angel Soft&lt;/strong&gt; in stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/angelsoft.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So angelically soft...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes – you read right. &lt;strong&gt;ANGEL SOFT – APPLE &amp;amp; CHEESE CREAM!!!&lt;/strong&gt; It is a wonderful baked good – some may call it a gift from God – that is heavenly soft bread filled with pieces of apple and cream cheese (or cheese cream). We are truly blessed to live in this day and age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/angelsoft2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So divine...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab a tray and tongs, and grab one or two or all of the Angel Softs. To balance your meal, you may want to pick one of Vie de France’s small &lt;strong&gt;sausage sandwiches&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll want to try all of them at some point, but don’t forget – the star of the show here is Angel Soft!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/hotdogs.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which one will share a tray with Angel Soft!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gotta pay before you eat. If you’re a バカ がいじん (baka gaijin, idiot foreigner) like me, just grab all the coins you have in your hand and start slowly picking out coins. The friendly servers behind the counter will throw you a bone and help you out by showing you the right coins to give them. Now that’s service!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/balanced.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A balanced breakfast!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit down and bask in the glory of what’s in front of you. You obviously need to eat the sausage sandwich first because &lt;strong&gt;YOU AWLAYS SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST!&lt;/strong&gt; You rush through the sausage sandwich because who has time for a sausage sandwich when Angel Soft is sitting there right in front of you, waiting to be enjoyed!? You finish the sandwich… And now it’s time. You bite into Angel Soft…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/inside.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So soft, so creamy, so apple, so angel soft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what else did you expect? &lt;strong&gt;It’s perfect!&lt;/strong&gt; おいしいです (oishīdesu, delicious)! The bread is soft. The cream cheese is there, but not overwhelming. It’s not scary American cream cheese, it’s Japanese cheese cream, in both amount and texture. A piece of an apple will appear here and there, teasing you to bite some more for maybe another piece of apple if you’re lucky. And then it’s over… And you feel like a million bucks for only 160 yen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow, dearest Angel Soft. I don’t know what I’m going to do when I leave Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gaijin Tips for Japan</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/14/gaijin-tips-for-japan/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/14/gaijin-tips-for-japan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;こんにちは (Konnichiwa, Hello)! It’s been nearly a week since I arrived in Japan and it’s been a blast so far. I’m spending this week and next working (and eating) at the Evernote office in Minato-ku, Tokyo. The following two weeks I will be taking some time off to explore Japan and watch the 16th World Kendo Championships!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience has been greatly enhanced by helpful friends, fellow Evernoters, and my kendo family of kohai, senpai, and sensei. Here are a collection of potentially useful tips if you are planning on traveling to Japan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a JR Pass if you’re planning on traveling outside of Tokyo.&lt;/strong&gt; A JR Pass will give you unlimited access to most of the JR train systems. They are available only to foreigners and are meant to encourage tourism to the Japanese world outside of Tokyo. You’ll also need to buy it BEFORE you get to Japan. They sell them in different lengths of time (7 days, 14 days, 21 days) and they are a bit pricey: a 7 day pass currently costs $236. But it pays for itself pretty quickly; if you’re planning to visit Kyoto, you’ll be coming out ahead already. There are a few places to purchase the JR Pass but I just got mine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japan-rail-pass.com/&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. I ordered mine Sunday night and got it Tuesday morning!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a Charles Schwab Checking Account.&lt;/strong&gt; This is generally useful advice. Carrying a ton of money around with you while traveling is annoying. Not getting ripped off while converting currency can also be difficult. A Schwab Checking Account makes all this easier. Just land at your destination and hit up the ATM. Worried about those ATM fees? Don’t worry – you’ll get all your ATM fees refunded! It’s pretty amazing. Read more about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account/checking_account_faqs&quot;&gt;Schwab’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a PASMO card.&lt;/strong&gt; You can buy a PASMO card at most train stations. This rechargeable card will let you zip through Tokyo Metro subway station gates and is also usable at コンビニ (konbini, convenience stores) like 7-Eleven. Note, the Tokyo Metro system is separate from the JR system, but it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/types/regular/index.html&quot;&gt;incredibly affordable&lt;/a&gt;. A short ride (1km - 6km) will cost $1.42 (170 yen) and on the other end a long ride (28km - 40km) will cost $2.58 (310 yen). What a steal!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with the yen to dollar conversion.&lt;/strong&gt; Generally speaking, &lt;strong&gt;100 yen is 1 dollar&lt;/strong&gt;, so 1000 yen = 10 dollars, 10,000 yen = 100 dollars, and so on. Right now the dollar is strong and the yen is weak, so American visitors will see their dollar fetch them nearly 120 yen! You can chop off the last two zeroes of a yen price to get a rough dollar approximation. An American friend, who lives in Japan, suggested a clever trick of simply adding the cents separator to yen prices which effectively chops off two zeroes. For example, 100 yen becomes 1.00. Happy converting!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of yen, always have cash on you!&lt;/strong&gt; I always imagined Japan as a country 20 years ahead of everyone technologically. But cash is king in this country, so don’t expect to use that credit card much. A PASMO card can be used in taxis and convenience stores, but you’ll want cash on you for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a Pocket Wifi.&lt;/strong&gt; Pocket Wifi is a little device that you turn on and it creates a Wifi network for you to connect to the Internet. You could buy a SIM card for your phone but if you’re traveling with others or using multiple devices, a Pocket Wifi is the best way to go as multiple devices can connect to it. The speed and reliability are top notch so far; I’ve even used MapMyRun with a Pocket Wifi to map my runs around Tokyo! There are various places to get them but it’ll cost roughly $3 to $4 per day. But before you buy one read the next tip!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider using AirBNB to find more affordable housing.&lt;/strong&gt; I used AirBNB to book housing for part of my trip. I’m staying in a pretty expensive part of Tokyo – Akasaka, Minato-ku – right now. There are lots of government buildings, embassies, and the Imperial Palace is a few stops away on the subway. Most Japanese friends remark that this area is very expensive, but the place I’m staying at is only $70 a night! Not only is it very affordable, it came with a &lt;strong&gt;Pocket Wifi&lt;/strong&gt; to use while I’m staying there! If you don’t have an AirBNB account yet, let me know so I can invite you and we both get free money. :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Maps is immensely useful.&lt;/strong&gt; Just let Google Maps know where you want to go and it’ll let you know which station to walk to, which train to catch, which station to transfer at, and where you need to walk to once you exit the station.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring a portable USB battery.&lt;/strong&gt; If the Pocket Wifi or your phone runs out of battery, stuff can get pretty hairy especially when you’re relying on Google Maps to help you get around. A portable USB battery will let you keep your devices juiced while on the go. No more living from power outlet to power outlet! Larger batteries even have multiple USB ports so you can charge multiple devices at once. I bought this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089DZNS4&quot;&gt;Satechi battery&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years ago. It has 2 USB ports and I have yet to see the thing run out of power when it’s charging my devices. It is a little on the heavy and large size so you may opt for something a little smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subway stations are cities below cities.&lt;/strong&gt; Some subway stations are ridiculously massive and have multiple entrances/exits. So follow the signs which are fortunately in both Japanese and English to get to the right place once you arrive at a station. The largest of the stations in Tokyo, Shinjuku Station, has over 200 exits and an arcade in it!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope these tips help anyone looking to travel to Japan!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Goodbye, Beard</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/02/goodbye-beard/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/02/goodbye-beard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a three-month journey, but today, I (slowly) said goodbye to a dear friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-02/beard.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My college professor and – more importantly – a man with some greats ideas, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~prc/&quot;&gt;Perry Cook&lt;/a&gt;, recommended I run this &lt;del&gt;photo of mass destruction&lt;/del&gt; work of art through Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://how-old.net/&quot;&gt;How Old Robot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-05-02/old-t.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being 10 years off from my actual age, what have we learned about the robot? To be young is to have no facial hair. Full beards make you a bit older. Handlebar mustaches make you look even older (and badass of course). But nothing compares to the aging power of a mean mustache!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adieu, friend!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Two Year Bloggiversary</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/01/two-year-bloggiversary/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/05/01/two-year-bloggiversary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One year ago I celebrated &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.gg/2014/05/01/one-year-bloggiversary/&quot;&gt;my first bloggiversary&lt;/a&gt;. And now – one year later – here we are at the two year bloggiversary! It was a busy year for the blog with &lt;strong&gt;58 posts written&lt;/strong&gt; and over &lt;strong&gt;13 thousand pageviews&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also been a busy year in general. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.gg/2014/11/10/hello-world-evernote/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;joined Evernote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November – that’s HALF A YEAR ago! And the fun doesn’t stop: I’ll be heading off to &lt;strong&gt;Japan for a month&lt;/strong&gt; this week and will be visiting family in &lt;strong&gt;Portugal in July&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals for this coming year include writing more, working on some open source projects, and trying to get another paper published so I can enhance my &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=orfurNwAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Google Scholar page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you again in May 2016 for another (short and somewhat vain) year-in-review!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hard Times Ahead...</title>
   <link href="/2015/04/29/hard-times-ahead/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/04/29/hard-times-ahead</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today marks the beginning of a difficult and trying time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles X&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; spiritual successor to one of my favorite games Xenoblade Chronicles &amp;mdash; was released in Japan. Unfortunately, Nintendo region locks their consoles and I don't own a Japanese Wii U. And while I can read the name of the game in Japanese &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;ゼ ノ ブ レ イ ド ク ロ ス&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; I doubt that proficiency would get me through the extremely story-driven game. The US version &quot;&lt;strong&gt;is scheduled for release sometime in 2015&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; Never has such a nebulous time window haunted me so very much.
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worry that all this anticipation is setting me up for disappointment. What if the game is bad? Everything so far looks good. Xenoblade Chronicles got a 36/40 rating from Famitsu; Xenoblade Chronicles X got a slightly lower, but still respectable 34/40. I’m not worried. Last December, the director of the game, Tetsuya Takahashi, tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconera.com/2014/12/04/xenoblade-chronicles-x-director-says-hes-finally-made-game-always-wanted/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“15 years have passed since Monolith was founded, and I believe that with this game I have finally met the challenge I had within me, of creating an RPG in which humans and robots can co-exist.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was hoping his tweet would end more like “creating an RPG that will truly captivate the world, restore people’s faith in the JRPG genre, and usher in a new golden era in Japanese video games,” but I’ll settle for human-robot synergy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-29/xcx_illustration.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I need you now...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I leave for Japan next week. I’ll be spending a month there… So that’s one month closer to the end of 2015! This is &lt;strong&gt;positive thinking&lt;/strong&gt; people!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>That's Allowed in Java!?</title>
   <link href="/2015/04/26/thats-allowed-in-java/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/04/26/thats-allowed-in-java</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you think you know a programming language really well. When I first looked at the Java code below, I thought there was &lt;strong&gt;NO WAY&lt;/strong&gt; this code could compile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;WTFBBQSauce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ClassLevel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		 &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// myString above (class-level) is shadowed by this method-level declaration&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MethodLevel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

         &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this will print &quot;MethodLevel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the declaration of myString in doWork would complain about a variable with the same name already being accessible. &lt;strong&gt;But I was wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. It compiles and runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? Why? This works because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xyzws.com/javafaq/what-is-variable-hiding-and-shadowing/15&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;variable shadowing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You have probably already seen variable shadowing in action in constructors and probably didn’t bat an eyelid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;WTFBBQSauce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sauceSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// size of WTFBBQSauce in ounces&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WTFBBQSauce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sauceSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// we explicitly use this.sauceSize to refer to the instance variable sauceSize&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// above; if we just say sauceSize we are referring to the parameter passed in&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sauceSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sauceSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I’m not going to run out and use this newfound knowledge. &lt;strong&gt;Variable shadowing makes code confusing.&lt;/strong&gt; My inner compiler (the thing that told me this would never compile) will help me steer clear of using this language feature. But given how programmers sometimes like to &lt;del&gt;show off&lt;/del&gt; discuss the finer points of languages, this knowledge isn’t totally useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/29887707/265791&quot;&gt;Abubakkar Rangara&lt;/a&gt; for helping me get to the bottom of my Java knowledge gap!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nintendo Gets with the DLC Program</title>
   <link href="/2015/04/24/nintendo-gets-with-the-dlc-program/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/04/24/nintendo-gets-with-the-dlc-program</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My friends and I played a lot (understatement) of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! for the GameCube in college. My dashers-in-crime, RW (ringleader of the big band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urpmusic.com/productions/about.php#about&quot;&gt;Urban Renewal Productions&lt;/a&gt;) and Theo (prisoner of war at UChicago’s PhD program) took this game &lt;strong&gt;seriously&lt;/strong&gt;. We got into fights over blue shells and talked a lot about what we wanted for the future of the series. DLC was one thing we all thought would be great for the series. Sixteen stages was nice and satisfied the “we only release complete games and that’s why we don’t do DLC” mantra that Nintendo lives by, but honestly none of us took issue with the idea of forking over money to download more stages to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-24/bundle.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behold and rejoice!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally! Eight years later, it finally happened. &lt;strong&gt;Nintendo got with the program and released DLC for the Mario Kart series.&lt;/strong&gt; Hallelujah! Mario Kart 8 (MK8) for the Wii U,  released in May of 2014, came with 32 tracks: 16 newly designed tracks and 16 retro tracks (tracks from old games given an HD spruce up). On release, it garnered positive reviews and was &lt;strong&gt;a complete Mario Kart experience&lt;/strong&gt;. But then something magical happened. Nintendo released two DLC packs that together added &lt;strong&gt;6 new characters, 8 new vehicles, and 16 new tracks to the game&lt;/strong&gt;! All for the relatively low cost of &lt;strong&gt;$11.99&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely appreciate Nintendo’s attitude that released games should be complete experiences (looking at you EA), but new content on top of an already-complete game is always welcome. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone is a winner.&lt;/strong&gt; Players get more content. Nintendo gets gamers “reactivated,” back into a game, and spending money. Good press for the DLC may also draw console sales, which the Wii U needs, and game sales. And by theming the DLC packs (the two released packs center around The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing), other franchises get some exposure as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-24/title.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Nintendo REALLY getting it!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exhibit of how good Nintendo might be getting the DLC thing: the newly updated title screen to MK8. It was updated from Mario drifting on a kart to &lt;del&gt;Zelda&lt;/del&gt; Link riding on the Master Cycle with Hyrule Castle in the background. All three aforementioned things are ONLY available via DLC. They’re &lt;strong&gt;subtlety advertising DLC on the title screen&lt;/strong&gt;! Very clever and sneaky…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this Nintendo, &lt;strong&gt;don’t stop&lt;/strong&gt;! Keep it coming! Like Reggie, &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-body-is-ready&quot;&gt;my body is ready&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting Google Play on Genymotion</title>
   <link href="/2015/04/22/google-play-and-genymotion/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/04/22/google-play-and-genymotion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a project in the works that requires running an Android app – Final Fantasy Record Keeper (FFRK) – on my computer. BlueStacks lets you install apps from the Play Store easily but BlueStacks also kind of sucks – especially the Mac (beta) version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genymotion.com/#!/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genymotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been a reliable and flexible Android emulator, but unfortunately it does not come with Google Play services out of the box, so installing applications from the Play Store is not possible. But with a little bit of work, you can power up your Genymotion emulator! These steps are largely adapted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2528952&quot;&gt;these instructions posted on the XDA-Developers&lt;/a&gt;, and feature some additional information regarding steps that tripped me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-22/ffrk-title.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set up the &lt;strong&gt;Android Debug Bridge&lt;/strong&gt; (adb). It comes bundled with the Android SDK. Google it if you don’t have it set up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download and install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genymotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Genymotion requires VirtualBox to work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Genymotion and add a new Android emulator. Originally I went with the Google Nexus 7 - 4.4.4, but that ended up causing FFRK to crash immediately on launch. The &lt;strong&gt;Google Nexus 7 2013 - 4.3&lt;/strong&gt; worked for me so use that one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;strong&gt;ARM Translation Installer&lt;/strong&gt; (9.4 MB) and &lt;strong&gt;Google Apps for Android 4.3&lt;/strong&gt; (91.7 MB). Both can be downloaded from this &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2528952&quot;&gt;helpful XDA-Developer post&lt;/a&gt;. It is very important that you &lt;strong&gt;do NOT unzip the ARM Translation zip file&lt;/strong&gt;. If you do, it’ll overwrite itself and make itself unusable in the next step. If your browser is set to automatically launch files, disable that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch the Genymotion virtual machine (VM) and &lt;strong&gt;drag the ARM Translation Zip file onto the VM&lt;/strong&gt;. The file will transfer and then you will be asked if you want to flash the VM. Agree, wait a bit, and then reboot the VM using &lt;em&gt;adb reboot&lt;/em&gt;. The adb command can take a little while to run so give it some time. If you don’t get asked to flash the VM, you probably unzipped the ARM Translation zip file. Go back to step 4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are two ways to install FFRK. You can download the APK from an external source and install it via adb (less steps, faster) OR you can install Google Play services on your VM and then install FFRK via the Play Store (more steps, but useful if you’re using a Google account to transfer game data from another device).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the FFRK APK from a site like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;APK Downloader&lt;/a&gt;. The package name for FFRK is com.dena.west.FFRK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install the APK via adb: &lt;em&gt;adb install com.dena.west.FFRK.apk&lt;/em&gt;. Note that if you had done this before flashing your VM with the ARM Translator, you’d get the INSTALL_FAILED_CPU_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE error. This, time it should install just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install via Google Play Store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drag the Google Apps file onto the VM&lt;/strong&gt;. The file transfers, and then you agree to the disclaimer, wait, and reboot via adb.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once rebooted, you’ll likely see Google Play Services crashing repeatedly. Don’t worry. Just &lt;strong&gt;make your way to the Play Store and log into a Google account&lt;/strong&gt;. Theoretically, you would then see a list of apps and services that could be updated, but I saw nothing so I just waited a bit (assuming things were upgrading in the background without my knowledge) and then rebooted the VM. After a few reboots, the Play Store updated and the Play Services crashes went away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search for Final Fantasy Record Keeper and hit the &lt;strong&gt;INSTALL&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-22/ffrk-playstore.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Installation Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FFRK should now launch and run, but it might be a bit laggy. To try to help reduce this, I quit the VM and reduced the resolution of the machine from 1200 x 1920 (320 DPI) to 600 x 960 (160 DPI).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The redditor lilmacaco (little monkey in Portuguese!) found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/31yetr/pc_players_which_emulator_do_you_use/cq6v94n&quot;&gt;turning down animation scales&lt;/a&gt; improved performance as well. Follow the aforementioned link for instructions on turning on Developer Options and then turning down animation scales. He recommends turning them down to .5, but I just turned mine off completely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>It's Good to be Back</title>
   <link href="/2015/04/20/good-to-be-back/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/04/20/good-to-be-back</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rewind to roughly a year ago. It’s May 2014. Everything was going well with marathon training for the 2014 San Francisco Marathon I was planning to run in July. I was increasing my mileage into the 18 mile range and feeling good. &lt;strong&gt;But then I got runner’s knee.&lt;/strong&gt; And I ended up not running the marathon. I stopped running both to recover and because when I did attempt to run, something felt off in my knee. My monthly running competitions with friends (highlighted on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mark.gg/fitness.html&quot;&gt;Fitness&lt;/a&gt; page) also came to and end. It sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, &lt;strong&gt;running has become a great way to ground myself&lt;/strong&gt;. Besides keeping me in decent shape, morning runs became a great time for me to collect thoughts from the previous days and prepare for the coming day. Losing that was tough both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, I’m back now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-20/2015-Woodside.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feels good!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I ran the Woodside Crossover 10K. I ran the trail race in 2014 and while running 4 miles up a hill (followed by 2 breezy miles downhill) sounds painful, it was the funnest race of 2014. The 2015 trail was in the same park, but took a slightly different trail; the uphill climb was spread more evenly throughout the 6 miles. Last year, I placed 4th in my age group. &lt;strong&gt;This year, I placed 2nd in my age group!&lt;/strong&gt; Progress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to running more frequently. I’ve already signed up for the San Francisco Half Marathon and am training with fellow Evernote coworkers who will also be running in the event. I’d like to take a stab at a marathon one day, but for now, I’ll take things nice and slow. I’m hungry for “marathon glory,” but I’d rather run shorter distances than risk getting injured again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onwards! :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/04/18/peeking-into-final-fantasy-record-keeper</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-18/ffrk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I've been playing a lot of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.finalfantasyrecordkeeper.com/&quot;&gt;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&lt;/a&gt; (FFRK)&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a free-to-play game available on iOS and Android. It's pretty fun! You get characters from different entries in the series, battle in different settings, get equipment, craft abilities, get experience points, get annoyed by a Moogle, get to listen to awesome music, unleash powerful limit breaks, and the rest of the whole JRPG shebang. In short, I'm hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I &lt;strong&gt;hooked up FFRK to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlesproxy.com&quot;&gt;Charles Proxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Charles is a nifty tool that can show you network traffic (via API calls) leaving and coming back to your phone. Let’s take a look at one API call: &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt;. This API is called at the beginning of a battle. A battle in FFRK consists of multiple rounds of enemies that you must fight in succession. This one API provides data for all rounds of a single battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the JSON response to this API, there is an array “rounds” that has metadata for each of the rounds of enemies you’ll face off against. Inside that array, is “drop_item_list” which describes an item that will be dropped when you complete the round. Also, you’ll find an array keyed by “enemy” which has metadata for each enemy. Nested a bit inside each enemy object, you’ll find a “drop_item_list” for that enemy which describes what item the enemy drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-18/items.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item dropped after a round ends (red) and item dropped when an enemy is destroyed (green).&lt;br /&gt;The items, respectively, are a Blue Potion and a Minor Fire Orb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference between drop_item_list nested under “round” and drop_item_list under “enemy?” Turns out some items are dropped after completing a round and not by a particular enemy. For example, potions (nested under “round”) were only dropped after all enemies were destroyed. You’ve probably noticed you never get a potion halfway through a round and this is why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the Ship Graveyard (FFV) a few times because &lt;strong&gt;figuring out how to get the Black Cowl reliably&lt;/strong&gt; is a great proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 340px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-18/siren.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can has Black Cowl?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first pass, I just looked at the response data and drop_item_list and mapped what I was seeing returned in the API to what I was getting in the game. Each drop_item_list has an integer keyed by “type” and after some data collection, the mappings so far look like: gold (11), potion (21), ability potion (31), weapon/armor (41), orb (51). I also mapped a few items specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;margin-bottom: 1em;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;item_id&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;rarity&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Item Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;40000007&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;51&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lesser White Orb&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;21009001&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;41&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cherry Staff (XII)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;21010002&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;41&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Shortbow (XII)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;40000031&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;51&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Minor Fire Orb&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;22053001&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;41&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Copper Cuirass (V)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;22054002&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;41&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Leather Armor (III)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if we had a more complete mapping of item_ids &lt;strong&gt;we could know as soon as a battle starts exactly what items will be dropped&lt;/strong&gt;! Turns out, it isn’t very difficult to map items to item_ids. Just hop over to the Party tab and you’ll get item_ids and you’ll see a request made to party/list which returns – among many other things – arrays for “materials” and “equipments” that you possess. item_id in the get_battle_init_data matches to equipment_id in the party/list API. I verified this by checking that the Cherry Staff (XII) equipment_id matched what I found while manually collecting item_ids. By the way, &lt;strong&gt;the Black Cowl item id is 22051015&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-18/cherrystaff.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;item_id = equipment_id&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we exploit this?&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s see! If you start a battle, pause immediately, look at the items that will drop, and then force restart the app, you’ll make another request to &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt;, but the drops do not change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are ways to re-roll drops as highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justpushstart.com/2015/04/final-fantasy-record-keeper-how-to-reroll-drops/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The general gist of the strategy is to force quit the app if you don’t get the drop you want and when you restart the app you decline to restart the battle. This throws you completely out of the battle flow. When you reenter you make a fresh call to &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt; that will get you new drops. This costs stamina – an energy unit required for battling that slowly restores over time – so &lt;strong&gt;re-rolling drops has a cost&lt;/strong&gt;. What does this look like at the API level?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-18/reset.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drops don't change unless you cross a red arrow!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start a battle, a series of API calls are made. &lt;em&gt;begin_session&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;begin_battle&lt;/em&gt; return a session key and then &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt; is called. If you do the re-roll trick mentioned above, a call is made to &lt;em&gt;quit&lt;/em&gt;. The middle block (green) of API calls that features two calls to &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt; is me starting the battle and force quitting it. Note that in this scenario, drops DO NOT change. To get drops to change, &lt;em&gt;quit&lt;/em&gt; (highlighted by the red arrows) must be called, or &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt; which is called when you complete a battle. Then &lt;em&gt;begin_session&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;begin_battle&lt;/em&gt; (which consumes stamina) are called again and this re-rolls drops. In short, if you don’t call &lt;em&gt;quit&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt; by completing the battle), drops won’t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we re-roll our drop list without costing us any stamina? Unlikely given the API design. Charles allows you to set &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/proxying/breakpoints/&quot;&gt;breakpoints&lt;/a&gt; on API calls. If we breakpoint on the &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt; response, we can check it for the item_ids we want. If they are present, we can allow the response through and everything proceeds as normal. If the item_ids don’t have what we care about, we abort the request. I did this six times (hit the breakpoint, copied the response, aborted the request) and then compared the all responses to &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt;. They were all exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;~/md5 r&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.txt
MD5 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;r1.txt&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 3467b0c7a40ebc3f72fa7b9165dc8220
MD5 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;r2.txt&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 3467b0c7a40ebc3f72fa7b9165dc8220
MD5 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;r3.txt&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 3467b0c7a40ebc3f72fa7b9165dc8220
MD5 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;r4.txt&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 3467b0c7a40ebc3f72fa7b9165dc8220
MD5 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;r5.txt&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 3467b0c7a40ebc3f72fa7b9165dc8220
MD5 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;r6.txt&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 3467b0c7a40ebc3f72fa7b9165dc8220&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to guess &lt;em&gt;begin_battle&lt;/em&gt; creates a battle session on the FFRK servers. Until &lt;em&gt;quit&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt; is called, repeated calls to &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data&lt;/em&gt; will return the same response. When you force quit the app and return and the app asks if you’d like to resume your interrupted battle, it’s likely noticing that you have an open battle session on the servers (opened by &lt;em&gt;begin_battle&lt;/em&gt;) that is not closed yet (by &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;quit&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this all for naught? Not necessarily. Unfortunately, we can’t re-roll drops for free, but we can save ourselves some time and take some of the guesswork out of farming for a particular drop. For example, to farm the Black Cowl using this system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hook up your device to Charles Proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the battle and pause as soon as the battle starts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look the response to &lt;em&gt;get_battle_init_data.&lt;/em&gt; Look at the drop_item_list for the enemy in the 4th round (index 3). That enemy is Siren – the boss.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the item_id is 22051015, congrats! You’re going to get a Black Cowl when you beat the boss.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the item_id is not 22051015, flee the battle; this calls the &lt;em&gt;flee&lt;/em&gt; API which is similar in functionality to the &lt;em&gt;quit&lt;/em&gt; API. Start the battle again and repeat the steps above until you get the Black Cowl item id in the API response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new method is more time-efficient and takes the guesswork out of farming drops, but it won’t prevent stamina drain. Oh wells!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/2015/04/02/auto-grinding-in-final-fantasy-type-0</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy Type-0&lt;/strong&gt; was originally released in Japan for the PSP in 2011. Four years later, an enhanced HD port made its way to the rest of the world. I’ve played through the game. Aside from the vestiges of the PSP that could not be fixed (bad camera, small areas, low-quality NPC sprites) the game is great. The battle system is fun, fast, and action-packed. The music – by Takeharu Ishimoto – is AWESOME! And if you exclude the conclusion, the story is pretty coherent for a Final Fantasy game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about this game is there really is no single main character, or even a small, manageable cast of main characters. You command a group of &lt;strong&gt;fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; powerful cadets at a military academy of a nation at war. When you deploy on a mission, you pick &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; cadets for your main party. If a cadet in the main party falls, you can’t use that cadet for the remainder of the mission. But you can replace that cadet with one from your reserves. There is no experience share so cadets only gain experience if they are actively fighting. Unless you want to bank your success on no cadets dying, &lt;strong&gt;it’s in your best interest to level up more than three cadets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; margin-top: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-04-02/fftype0.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So many characters to level up!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my younger days, I’d relish the opportunity to spend hours upon hours grinding all fourteen characters. But the me of today &lt;del&gt;can’t&lt;/del&gt; shouldn’t do that. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/auto-agito&quot;&gt;Auto Agito&lt;/a&gt; - a little workflow I conjured up to automatically level up your cadets. This takes advantage of a feature of the game: &lt;strong&gt;Secret Training&lt;/strong&gt;. You can send a cadet to Secret Training, take a break from playing the game (like go to sleep or work), and then return later and reap free experience. By moving the PS4’s system clock forward you can simulate going to work or sleep! Auto Agito automates and repeats this entire flow: starting Secret Training, advancing time, and then returning to reap the experience. Here’s a video showing one iteration of the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDU4rSxBPw8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/auto-agito/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; for specifics on equipment needed and steps involved. Yes, grinding is a quintessential part of the JRPG experience. But when I see room for automation, I can’t help but see how far I can take things. Happy (automatic) leveling!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PayPal - One Step Forward, One Step Backward</title>
   <link href="/2015/03/28/paypal-steps-backward/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/03/28/paypal-steps-backward</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s about DAMN time! PayPal has FINALLY added support for two-factor authentication in their iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-03-28/pp-2factor.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINALLY!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it wouldn’t be PayPal if they didn’t do something stupid to balance out this step forward. Turns out, logging into PayPal on your computer is more annoying if you use 2-factor authentication. How so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to paypal.com and enter your login credentials (i.e. email and password) and press enter. You’ll be taken to another screen where you’re asked to &lt;strong&gt;enter your login credentials again.&lt;/strong&gt; Why? The page says, “We’re sorry. We need you to login again to verify additional security information.” You enter your credentials again and after that you are finally prompted for your security code. PayPal just reinvented two-factor login as a 3-step process with 2 of the steps sharing the same form of authentication!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-03-28/pp-stupid.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first query, if I have two factor authentication turned on, just route the request to the proper endpoint. Don’t redirect me to another webpage where I have to enter my login details again. I’m the customer. I’m the one who gets to be lazy. Not you, PayPal! ME! ME ME ME!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing PayPal does get right is apologizing upfront: “We’re sorry.” You should be sorry; because this is mind-bogglingly stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Many Faces of LinkedIn Premium</title>
   <link href="/2015/03/20/linkedin-premium/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/03/20/linkedin-premium</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was browsing LinkedIn the other day on my iPhone. I opened up the navigation menu and I clicked on &lt;strong&gt;Try Premium for free&lt;/strong&gt; because for some weird reason I was drawn to it. Totally &lt;strong&gt;unrelated&lt;/strong&gt; observation: it’s the only menu item with a colored icon. In we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-03-20/linkedin-gopremium.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something drew me in...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what we find. There are three different pages to look at. Here is a GIF animating through them. &lt;strong&gt;Take a look!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-03-20/linkedin-premium.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three tiers: &lt;strong&gt;Business&lt;/strong&gt; at $29.99 per month, &lt;strong&gt;Business Plus&lt;/strong&gt; at $59.99 per month, and &lt;strong&gt;Executive&lt;/strong&gt; at $99.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There isn’t much difference between the three different tiers. Price (obviously) and tier name (seemingly meaningless because I don’t see this used anywhere else on the site) aside, the only difference is the amount of InMails you are allotted. When first swiping through these pages, I thought something was wrong because the feature lists are nearly identical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The icon for the messaging through Open Profile feature looks like a loading spinner that is stuck. Ugh!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we’re nitpicking, for features that have text spanning two lines, the icon and text do not line up nicely. Double ugh!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow – InMails cost a lot of money. Are you telling me these unsolicited messages on LinkedIn cost people (Hey – recruiters are people too!) between $3.33 (Executive tier) and $6 (Business tier) per message!? Wild!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clicking on the features doesn’t give me any more information about that feature. You’re trying to sell me something here! If I want to know what “Expanded profiles” means, you should let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, I’m drawn to the “Start your free trial” button, which on a totally &lt;strong&gt;unrelated&lt;/strong&gt; note, is the nastiest shade of orange I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do other platforms sell Premium better?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the Premium purchase options on the web version. It seems the right hand and left hand don’t appear to be on the same page at LinkedIn. The pitch and approach here is COMPLETELY different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-03-20/linkedin-web800.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are four tiers: &lt;strong&gt;Job Seeker&lt;/strong&gt; at $29.99 per month, &lt;strong&gt;Business Plus&lt;/strong&gt; at $59.99 a month, &lt;strong&gt;Sales Navigator Professional&lt;/strong&gt; at $79.99 per month, and &lt;strong&gt;Recruiter Life&lt;/strong&gt; (which I think should be renamed to #RecruiterLife) at $119.95 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything flows nicely here. The call-to-action at the top of the page “What do you want to achieve with your free trial of Premium?” compliments the display of the four different tiers below, of which each has a short answer to the aforementioned question (e.g. “Unlock sales opportunities”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the names for tiers don’t mesh well together. I can be a Job Seeker or a Sales Navigator Professional, but I can’t be a Business Plus or a Recruiter Life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, WTF is a Sales Navigator Professional? A modern-day pirate navigating the treacherous seas of the business world?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the difference between tiers here is a little better. As you pay more, you get more features. Job Seeker and Business Plus highlight 4 features, Sales Navigator Professional highlights 6, and Recruiter Life highlights 8. It makes higher tiers look more appealing deal because you’re getting more than “more InMail.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The orange for the Recruiter Life tier (#e68523) is also much better compared to the disgusting orange on the iOS version (#edb220).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every tier except the lowly Job Seeker tier has an option to go annually. Not only do you save 20% by committing to an annual basis, but another benefit is that it’s “Easier to expense with a single receipt.” LinkedIn knows the struggles of the modern-day worker and is addressing those issues head-on!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-03-20/li-relief.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What a relief!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completeness’ sake, here is what the Android version looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-03-20/linkedin-android.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks very similar to the iOS version, except it’s uglier and Android users get monthly and yearly sign-up options. Surprisingly, there is no option for a free trial. Has LinkedIn managed to successfully monetize Android users with terrible design or have they simply given up all hope for ever making money on the Android platform?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Need Big Friggin' Images?</title>
   <link href="/2015/02/22/need-big-friggin-images/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/02/22/need-big-friggin-images</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found myself in need of some &lt;strong&gt;big friggin’ images&lt;/strong&gt; the other day. After scouring the web for a while and coming up with paltry-sized images (ONLY hundreds of megabytes), I decided to just create some myself. I whipped up a quick Python script – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/markcerqueira/459fa0a3aae001d3471f&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;imggen.py&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – that uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pillow.readthedocs.org/&quot;&gt;Pillow image library&lt;/a&gt; to generate square images where each pixel is a random color. It’s certainly no remarkable coding achievement, but the output is pretty pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-02-22/RGBA_400_regular.PNG&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;160k Pixels!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The images also got really big and took a long time to generate as the size increased.&lt;/strong&gt; Running the script with size 2000 pixels generated a 13.9 MB image in 23 seconds; 16000 pixels, 22 minutes, 875 MB; 34000 pixels, 107 minutes, 3.95 GB! Yes, I know plenty about time and space complexity for algorithms; just let me enjoy this moment as my computer struggles to generate these images!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I toyed around the script to generate images in &lt;strong&gt;different styles.&lt;/strong&gt; Below is a composition of four variations of imggen.py. Clockwise from top left: the &lt;strong&gt;original&lt;/strong&gt; script that generates a random color for every pixel, a &lt;strong&gt;rows&lt;/strong&gt; version that picks a random color and uses that for the entire row, a &lt;strong&gt;grayscale&lt;/strong&gt; version that generates a random grayscale color for every pixel, and a &lt;strong&gt;columns&lt;/strong&gt; version that is similar to the rows version, but for columns instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-02-22/RGBA_400_collection.PNG&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;640k Pixels in 4 Servings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! Such beauty! Much pixels! Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/markcerqueira/459fa0a3aae001d3471f&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;imggen.py&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and you can be a (computer) artist too!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don't Call Execute() on AsyncTasks</title>
   <link href="/2015/02/14/dont-call-execute-on-asynctask/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/02/14/dont-call-execute-on-asynctask</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;style media=&quot;screen&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;

blockquote {
  font-size: 8px;
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  margin-left: 50px;
  padding-left: 15px;
  border-left: 3px solid #ccc;
}

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AsyncTasks are pretty useful. But when you submit them for execution, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. Regarding the order of execution for AsyncTasks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;When first introduced, AsyncTasks were executed serially on a single background thread. Starting with DONUT, this was changed to a pool of threads allowing multiple tasks to operate in parallel. Starting with HONEYCOMB, tasks are executed on a single thread to avoid common application errors caused by parallel execution. If you truly want parallel execution, you can invoke executeOnExecutor() with THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool - seems simple enough. &lt;strong&gt;Calling execute() will queue your AsyncTask onto a single thread. But this can be problematic.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this might take a long time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AsyncTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fileDownloadTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getAsyncTaskToDownloadLargeFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fileDownloadTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this should not take a long time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AsyncTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseQueryTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getAsyncTaskToMakeQuickQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseQueryTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with this? Your quick database query task we will blocked by your long file download task. This is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to remedy this? &lt;strong&gt;It’s easy: NEVER use execute() and ALWAYS use executeOnExecutor().&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need things queued up serially pass SERIAL_EXECUTOR, otherwise pass THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR. You’ll need to do a little more thinking, but the end result will be a deliberate choice that YOU make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not always just use THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR to avoid blocking other AsyncTasks? Using the SERIAL_EXECUTOR is an easy way to get the functionality of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_%28computer_science%29&quot;&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt; without actually using a barrier. If you need multiple pieces of information fetched before you can do something, you can queue them up on the SERIAL_EXECUTOR. When the last task queued is done, you know the others must have finished running too. That said, you should still call executeOnExecutor(SERIAL_EXECUTOR) instead of execute() in this case!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy safe – whether serially or parallel – coding!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2013 Anime Roundup</title>
   <link href="/2015/01/22/2013-anime-roundup/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/01/22/2013-anime-roundup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I watched about a metric ton (i.e. 18 series) of anime in 2013. I caught up on some of the hot series from previous seasons so most of the anime I watched I really, really enjoyed. Here’s a breakdown ranging from must-watch series to skips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your life isn't complete until you watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toradora&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Welcome to the NHK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great - Definitely worth a watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hataraku Maou-sama!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knights of Sidonia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Madoka Magica&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Psycho-Pass&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sword Art Online (Part 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good - worth watching if you like the genre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aldnoah Zero&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kill la Kill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log Horizon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No Game No Life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shingeki no Bahamut&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sword Art Online 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decent - would recommend these under specific circumstances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Akame ga Kill!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angel Beats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Psycho Pass 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tokyo Ghoul&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zankyou no Terror&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip - I wish I could forget I watched this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sword Art Online (Part 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a &lt;strong&gt;rough&lt;/strong&gt; breakdown. I found myself moving stuff between the great and good group and just stopped after a while. Depending on your preferences some of these may be more or less appealing. Let me know if you have any questions or want to know my thoughts about any of these series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the horizon, I’m very pumped to watch the second season of Aldnoah Zero and Log Horizon!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The recommended way of building a Settings screen in Android is to define preferences in an XML file and then load that file in a PreferenceActivity or PreferenceFragment. But that only works if you know all your preferences at compile-time. And sometimes we don’t know them. Sometimes, we want to be a little more flexible with preference loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected of Android documentation, we are told, “Your app’s settings are generally pre-determined, although you can still modify the collection at runtime,” but then given no documentation as to how to add or remove things from the collection. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it’s not difficult to do this. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/flexible_preferences&quot;&gt;flexible_preferences&lt;/a&gt; – a short Android application that shows you how to do gymnastics with Android Preferences. Tricks include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses a custom layout file so you can show stuff besides the preferences like a loading spinner if you’re fetching preferences over the wire.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create preferences without an XML file!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hide and show preferences based on input (e.g. hide all other preferences if we toggle one particular preference to the off state).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the best part (besides using the OP LinkedHashMap data structure) is it still leverages Android’s built-in preference functionality, so you get a lot of stuff for free!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don't Tell Me to Share a Secret</title>
   <link href="/2015/01/08/dont-tell-me-to-share-a-secret-key/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/01/08/dont-tell-me-to-share-a-secret-key</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My friend Spencer asked me if I could beta test Mini Audicle for iOS. I agreed and asked him if he had any performance monitoring tools set up. Long story short, I ended up integrating &lt;strong&gt;Crittercism&lt;/strong&gt; (my favorite crash monitoring tool) into Mini Audicle iOS so he could collect crash data from every user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important part of the Crittercism integration process is &lt;strong&gt;uploading dSYMs - debug symbol files&lt;/strong&gt;. For release builds, debug symbols are removed to reduce the binary size but this makes crash logs much less useful. Fortunately, dSYM files help us decode (symbolicate) these crash reports. It’s super important to upload dSYMs if you want to make any sense of stack traces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Crittercism &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.crittercism.com/articles/knowledge_base/Uploading-dSYMs-to-Crittercism-automatically/&quot;&gt;provides thorough instructions&lt;/a&gt; on setting up automatic dSYM upload, but it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions help you set up a script that runs after the build phase is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2015-01-08/not_the_key.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something is fishy here...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with this? &lt;strong&gt;The API key is right there, in plain sight!&lt;/strong&gt; As soon as you push this up, your key is available for all to see! While it seems you currently can’t do much damage with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.crittercism.com/api/api.html&quot;&gt;Crittercism REST API&lt;/a&gt;, you probably shouldn’t instruct customers to just put their API key out there for everyone to see. You should AT LEAST warn them about the potential dangers of sharing this key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefit of the doubt time!&lt;/strong&gt; I can imagine Crittercism is mostly integrated into enterprise applications that are hosted &lt;strong&gt;privately&lt;/strong&gt;. But even in that case, ideally, only your build server, which makes builds for non-developers, would have access to the API key. To that end, Crittercism provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Crittercism+dSYM+Plugin&quot;&gt;Jenkins plugin&lt;/a&gt; eliminating the need to put the API key directly in your source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re a public open source project, do not have a build server, and want to have auto-uploading dSYMs to Crittercism what options do you have? You can still use their method safely by modifying Crittercism’s provided instructions a bit. Here is what Mini Audicle iOS uses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# only upload during Release builds, otherwise every build will upload a dSYM&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CONFIGURATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Release&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# put the secret key in this file as an environmental variable&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; -f ~/.crittercism_keys &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# this is required to inject the environmental variables into&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# the shell spawned by Xcode&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.crittercism_keys

        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;APP_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;MY_FIRST_APP_ID_abcdefghi&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# instead of having your API key here, it is copied in from the&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# environmental varible&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;MINI_AUDICLE_SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# run the script&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;SRCROOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/ios/libs/Crittercism/dsym_upload.sh
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;~/.crittercism_keys does not exist. Not uploading dSYM!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi
else
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Not a Release build so not auto-uploading dSYM file.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It requires a little setup (creating the .crittercism_keys file), but we can now &lt;strong&gt;both auto-upload dSYMs and host this project publicly without exposing the API key&lt;/strong&gt;. This script also only upload dSYMs for Release builds.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dropbox and iTunes</title>
   <link href="/2014/12/22/dropbox-and-itunes/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/12/22/dropbox-and-itunes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; - If you keep your iTunes library in Dropbox, it’s all sunshine and rainbows until you realize Dropbox is syncing iTunes Library.itl and iTunes Library.xml after EVERY song play or skip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting your iTunes library in Dropbox sounds like a great idea. And for the most part it is. You get your iTunes library on every computer you sync with Dropbox. You add music on one computer, and you get it on the others. Generally, it’s convenient and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble starts when we look at the files that manage our library: &lt;strong&gt;iTunes Library.itl&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;iTunes Library.xml&lt;/strong&gt;. Every time a song is touched (played or even skipped), these two files are updated. Every time the files are updated, they are synced to Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-12-22/db_sync.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My iTunes Library (~18,000 songs) itl and xml files are &lt;strong&gt;5.1 MB&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;28.3 MB&lt;/strong&gt; respectively. Let’s say the average song is 4 minutes long. If you are listening to my iTunes library for an hour (15 songs), that’s &lt;strong&gt;500 MB worth of file changes that are synced to Dropbox in one hour&lt;/strong&gt;! We’re easily talking &lt;strong&gt;gigabytes of bandwidth consumed daily&lt;/strong&gt; if you listen for more than a couple of hours. It’s pretty ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a huge deal yet. But still, with bandwidth caps looming in the future, it’s something worth thinking about. So, can we make iTunes in Dropbox less bandwidth hungry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could clean up my library and make it smaller. My library is huge and I’m usually only listening to a very small subset of it. That said, it’s nice to have access to my entire library at all times. Especially when I get a hankering for some old jams I haven’t listened to in a while. However, this solution is too easy and we’d learn little if we stopped here, so let’s ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GTFO XML! iTunes only uses the iTunes Library.itl file to organize your entire library. As Apple documents in &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201610&quot;&gt;this support article&lt;/a&gt;, the iTunes Library.xml file makes “your music and playlists available to other applications on your computer” like iPhoto and iMovie. That’s stuff I don’t need. I deleted my iTunes Library.xml file hoping iTunes would happily chug along without it. iTunes loaded fine as expected, but it then quickly recreated the XML file in all it’s 28.3 MB glory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I can’t make iTunes Library.xml go away, I should be able to tell Dropbox to ignore that file and not sync it right? Wrong! Dropbox’s Selective Sync settings only allow you to ignore folders; there is currently no support for ignoring files. The first link that comes up when I Google “Dropbox ignore file” looks like a feature request posted on Dropbox’s forums that unfortunately 404s. So I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropboxforum.com/hc/communities/public/questions/201339089-Selective-sync-should-allow-us-to-ignore-specific-files-within-a-folder&quot;&gt;new post requesting the feature&lt;/a&gt;. For now, you can “hack” file ignore with the steps from this &lt;a href=&quot;http://superuser.com/a/757498&quot;&gt;Super User answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-12-22/improvement.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting better...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that the XML file is no longer synced, syncs are 85% leaner!&lt;/strong&gt; But we could do better… if we worked at Apple and could make important engineering decisions. We know a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The itl file that manages our library’s metadata seems to be purposefully obfuscated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new iTunes 12 icon is absolutely hideous.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The itl file (5.1 MB) has enough information in it to re-generate the XML file (28.3 MB).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;XML is too too verbose. The itl file likely contains some other information given my XML file can be compressed from 28.3 MB to 1.7 MB using the built-in archiver in OS X. That leaves 3.4 MB (5.1 MB - 1.7 MB) of mystery in that file!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s use an entry in our iTunes Library.xml file to get an idea of what an entry in the itl file would look like. Here’s a song entry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml-cheetah&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml+cheetah&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Track ID&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;21743&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Name&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;Dead Sea (Tower of Geddon)&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Artist&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;Chrono Cross&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Album Artist&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;Yasunori Mitsuda&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Composer&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;Yasunori Mitsuda&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Album&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;Chrono Cross OST&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Genre&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;Game&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Kind&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;MPEG audio file&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Size&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;7803584&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Total Time&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;190406&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Disc Number&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Disc Count&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Track Number&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Track Count&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;26&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Year&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;1999&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Date Modified&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;2011-02-09T04:15:40Z&amp;lt;/date&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Date Added&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;2011-02-09T04:12:57Z&amp;lt;/date&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Bit Rate&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;320&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Sample Rate&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;44100&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Play Count&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;83&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Play Date&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;3502032647&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Play Date UTC&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;2014-12-21T23:50:47Z&amp;lt;/date&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Skip Count&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;9&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Skip Date&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;2013-11-14T02:08:13Z&amp;lt;/date&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Rating&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;100&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Album Rating&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;100&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Album Rating Computed&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;true/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Artwork Count&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Persistent ID&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;8633DA1C1A82A603&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Track Type&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;File&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Location&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!----&amp;gt;.mp3&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;File Folder Count&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Library Folder Count&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/integer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this data doesn’t need to be updated frequently. In fact, only 5 of the 31 values above (Play Count, Play Date, Play Date UTC, Skip Count, Skip Date) would trigger the file changes after playing or skipping a song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iTunes could break these “volatile” fields into a separate file and use the track ID if it ever needed to match data between the two files. This iTunes Volatile Library.itl file would sync at the current frequency during playback (but it would be smaller in size), while the file containing the other metadata would change and sync less frequently. If keeping this data 100% accurate across your computers isn’t very important, you could even ignore this file using the Dropbox ignore-file-hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-12-22/db_fresh.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Dre - can you makes iTunes the leanest and illest it can be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other solutions like storing volatile data in iCloud and tying that to your Apple account. Also, if the XML file was still used to manage your library (instead of the obfuscated binary itl file format), you could even store your iTunes Library in git and push and pull changes to the XML file across different computers. How wonderful it would be to resolve a merge conflict in iTunes Library.xml? Dear God – did I play that song 4 times or 6 times!?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Context is Live in Evernote for Android!</title>
   <link href="/2014/12/18/context-is-live-in-evernote-for-android/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/12/18/context-is-live-in-evernote-for-android</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a little over a month since I joined Team Android at Evernote. I’m happy to announce that I’ve been busy along with the rest of the team bringing you an update to our Android app. Among many other things, &lt;strong&gt;Evernote for Android now supports Context!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-12-18/context_nexus.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Context? Say you’re procrastinating at work browsing the Washington Post, and you run into an article about Japan recently beating out Scotland for top scotch of the year. Take that Scotland! You use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/webclipper/&quot;&gt;Evernote Web Clipper&lt;/a&gt; to save it to your ever-growing notebook of articles you promise you’ll read one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, you finally get around to reading that article. You reach the end and normally that’d be the end. But with Context, you’ll find articles and notes related to the one you just finished reading. Context pulls content from sources like The Wall Street Journal, your own notes, and even your LinkedIn contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m biased, but I think it’s pretty cool. The “classical model of intelligence” is based around how much you can remember without any tools to assist you. But today people have extremely powerful and more importantly - extremely connected - devices in their pockets. I think the “modern model of intelligence” assesses how quickly we are able to access the information we need. Evernote remembers everything for us, so we’re covered there pretty well. Now, Context helps us find related information that can further augment our knowledge and increase our productivity. That is, unless spending an afternoon reading about scotch is not your definition of productive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/12/19/context-makes-informed-work-android-windows/&quot;&gt;Evernote’s official press release on Context for Android&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/context/faq/&quot;&gt;Context FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, and download &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote&quot;&gt;Evernote from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Open Letter to the Lollipop Keyboard</title>
   <link href="/2014/12/10/lollipops-keyboard/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/12/10/lollipops-keyboard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dearest Lollipop Keyboard,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most upsetting. I upgraded my Nexus 7 to Android Lollipop and quickly regretted it after using you for the first time. &lt;strong&gt;Fatigued&lt;/strong&gt; is the best word to describe how I felt. Why would I feel fatigued!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just take a look at yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-12-10/lollipop.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have you become!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The freaking lines separating your keys are gone.&lt;/strong&gt; Along with the characters themselves, the lines helped my finger hit its target. Yes, I do type with just one finger. They’re gone. I typed a little more and my fears were confirmed; I was exerting myself more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. You were an amazing keyboard and then Google came along and lathered “Material Design” all over you. I’m sick of the excess use of bright white, I’m sick of thin grey fonts on white backgrounds, I’m sick of everything going flat, and I’m sick of labeling all this under some holier-than-thou Material Design umbrella and expecting everyone to be excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely disgruntled,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thoughts on Serial</title>
   <link href="/2014/12/08/thoughts-on-serial/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/12/08/thoughts-on-serial</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-12-08/serial-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Serial&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;After hearing about this podcast that was blowing up the charts, I finally checked out &lt;strong&gt;Serial&lt;/strong&gt;. Serial follows the 1999 Baltimore murder of a high school girl, Hae Min Lee. Her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was charged and found guilty of the murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime. While there was scant physical evidence incriminating Anand, the prosecution had a star witness: Adnan's friend Jay, who said he helped bury the body of Lee after Adnan murdered her. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed and narrated by Sarah Koenig, each week we walk alongside Koenig as she explores every facet of this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started listening on Monday. On Tuesday, I had blown thrown 10 episodes – that’s &lt;strong&gt;7 hours of content in two days&lt;/strong&gt;! It’s good. It gets you hooked. They did a pretty stand-up job producing this show. While I eagerly wait for my next fix of Serial (delivered on Thursdays), I put some of my thoughts about the show on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regarding &lt;strong&gt;who I think committed the murder&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t know. There just isn’t enough hard evidence to point in any direction. It could be Adnan. It could be Jay. It could be someone we have no idea about.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;influence of race&lt;/strong&gt; is too understated. America is far from post-racial today and it wasn’t any better in 1999. Here we have a Pakistani guy being accused by a black man of killing a Korean girl, in a courtroom with a predominantly black jury. Koenig touches on this only briefly. I can see why she doesn’t want her show to blandly conclude “just blame it on race,” but race could explain a lot of why things went down the way they did.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How good must it feel to be that marketing person at &lt;strong&gt;MailChimp&lt;/strong&gt; that set up the sponsorship of Serial? #MailKimp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adnan is going before the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to argue that his lawyer did not effectively represent him during the trial. The judiciary should be objective, but I wonder if the &lt;strong&gt;clout of Serial will have any sway&lt;/strong&gt; – even if minimal – on their thought process and decision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will &lt;strong&gt;Serial inspire clones&lt;/strong&gt; where people investigate crimes of supposed false imprisonment? What effect will this have on people who claim they are falsely imprisoned, and will these people start being more vocal about their story in the hopes that someone picks it up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will &lt;strong&gt;Redditors (the majority of who think Adnan is innocent) riot&lt;/strong&gt; if Adnan doesn’t win his appeal in January?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;criminal justice system is total crap&lt;/strong&gt;. It sounds like if Adnan admitted to the murder and showed remorse, he might’ve gotten a lighter sentence. So if he actually didn’t do it, he could admit he did to try to get a reduced sentence. He stuck to his guns hoping the jury would not decide he was guilty, and now he’ll spend the rest of his life in jail.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I was falsely imprisoned I’d be super pissed&lt;/strong&gt; and I’d let people know it, especially if someone came to me and asked me to spill my guts out. But I don’t know what fifteen years in prison would do to someone. Adnan might’ve resigned himself long ago to the fact that he will probably never leave the prison system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;only two episodes left in season one&lt;/strong&gt;. Serial got funding for another season, but it’ll be a while before that comes out. What will I do without Serial!?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;NPR held Serial hostage during its pledge drives&lt;/strong&gt;, could they be massively shortened!? Just imagine: “if we can reach a trillion dollars in donations in one week, we’ll release Serial twice a week year-round!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven’t checked out Serial yet? Set some time aside and &lt;a href=&quot;http://serialpodcast.org/&quot;&gt;do it now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Finish the Flow!</title>
   <link href="/2014/11/18/finish-the-flow/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/11/18/finish-the-flow</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I got a follower on Instagram. Yay! But, I think this follower was a scammer. Any time someone on the internet invites you to visit a website to get to know them better, it’s usually a scam. Especially when their name is MissDiamond. Bummer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good community member, I decided to report this user. Here’s what the “reporting a user on Instagram” user flow looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-11-18/instagram.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See that last screen where Instagram thanks me for reporting this user? I sat on that screen for a while. Little did I know I had to &lt;strong&gt;press “Cancel” in the top left to dismiss the confirmation&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s pretty bad. I just completed doing something. Don’t make me doubt myself by forcing me to hit a button that says “Cancel.” Put a button that says “OK” or something more positive! &lt;strong&gt;Finish the flow, please!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Weekend with Tales of Hearts R</title>
   <link href="/2014/11/16/weekend-with-tales-of-hearts-r/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/11/16/weekend-with-tales-of-hearts-r</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-11-16/tohr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tales of Hearts R&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;strong&gt;Tales of Hearts R&lt;/strong&gt; this week. Originally released in Japan in 2008 on the Nintendo DS, six years later a re-imagining of the original made its way to the PlayStation Vita in the West. As the weekend comes to a close, I unabashedly admit that I poured twelve hours into this game! I'm a fan of the Tales series so I'm a little biased and I have yet to finish the game, but this game is great so far. Here are some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of reviews about this game give the &lt;strong&gt;localization&lt;/strong&gt; a lot of flak. My command of Japanese is pretty poor, but I haven’t run into anything that’s offensively translated yet. They did “translate” the protagonist’s name from Shing to Kor, which I think is pretty weird, given they left other Japanese names like Kohaku and Hisui as is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;story&lt;/strong&gt; is somewhat cheesy, but I like it. The theme in this game, as the title hints at rather strongly, is about love and “meetings between hearts.” So far, there is enough mystery in the plot and characters that I want to keep playing to see what comes out of the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;battle system&lt;/strong&gt; is what you’d expect of a Tales game: lots of action and a lot of fun. The AI for the characters you don’t control is pretty smart too; I can count on one hand the times I questioned what my allies were doing!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;growth system&lt;/strong&gt; is cool. Characters gain EXP from slaying fiends and as they level up, they gain points to improve their stats. Points can be allocated over six categories that improve different groups of stats. Spend enough points in a category and it will level up, granting new skills. Leveling up categories uniformly is encouraged as bonuses are awarded when adjacent categories reach certain levels. All in all, the system makes me want to level up more and more so I can improve my characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, time to squeeze in a few more hours with Tales of Hearts R before I go to bed! :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thoughts on Archon Mode</title>
   <link href="/2014/11/12/thoughts-on-archon-mode/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/11/12/thoughts-on-archon-mode</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, Blizzard unveiled the final chapter in the StarCraft 2 trilogy: Legacy of the Void. Naturally, a lot of attention has been paid to the slew of additions and changes to the multiplayer compositions for each race, but one of the cooler announcements was the unveiling of &lt;strong&gt;Archon Mode&lt;/strong&gt;. Like two High Templars joining to form a single formidable Archon, in Archon Mode, two players control a single base/army and battle a single foe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-11-12/archon.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archon Mode!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this needed? &lt;strong&gt;StarCraft is hard.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s really freaking hard. You need to macro to keep your economy healthy. You need to micro to get the most out of every unit in engagements. And if you want to really do well, you need to split your army and micro on multiple fronts. Having a good strategy is key, but mechanics play an even larger role in success. You need to be able to execute a plan. In that respect, &lt;strong&gt;playing StarCraft can be very discouraging.&lt;/strong&gt; Every time you find yourself improving, the match-making system matches you up with better and better opponents. Even at the professional level, there are clear cases where improved – beyond the already ridiculously impressive – level of multi-tasking and mechanics would impact the flow of a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archon Mode should alleviate this somewhat and &lt;strong&gt;make the game more approachable&lt;/strong&gt;, for all skill levels. It’ll be interesting to see how far Blizzard runs with this. It’d be cool to see a ladder just for Archon Mode, where two people can face off against two other people… or one Korean! While I’m excited to play with all the new units, I’m excited to merge with a friend and become an OP (over-powered) Archon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about Archon Mode in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/16658015/legacy-of-the-void-archon-mode-11-8-2014&quot;&gt;official announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PayPal and Delusions of Grandeur</title>
   <link href="/2014/10/22/paypal-and-delusions-of-grandeur/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/10/22/paypal-and-delusions-of-grandeur</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr - PayPal thinks they’re awesome, but I still think they suck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It always blows my mind when PayPal acts like a company that’s succeeding at doing everything right. After the recent iCloud hack, where a bunch of celebrities had risqué photos leaked, PayPal decided to throw a punch at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-22/paypal_ad.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think with an ad like this, PayPal is really at the forefront of protecting their customers. &lt;strong&gt;WRONG&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, I raged hard when PayPal said they were &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/06/04/kicking-the-tires-with-paypal/&quot;&gt;“kicking the tires”&lt;/a&gt; when it came to integrating Apple’s TouchID API into their iOS app. Raged because they were talking about integrating TouchID when their iOS app didn’t even support two-factor authentication. Months later, &lt;strong&gt;the PayPal iOS app still does not support two-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; and of course, does not support TouchID either. Upping the ante on how bad they are, the app now instructs you to “download the new app” that supports two-factor authentication. &lt;strong&gt;No such version exists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-22/ios_lies.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's all a lie!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I log onto PayPal on my computer, which supports two-factor authentication, &lt;strong&gt;I’m presented with the two-factor authentication prompt… EVERY SINGLE TIME&lt;/strong&gt;. Most services with two-factor authentication let you check a box to “remember this computer.” This drops an auth token on your computer that usually expires in a really, really long time. When you try logging on again, the auth token is used to skip the security code part of authentication. PayPal can’t be troubled with making security more convenient. &lt;strong&gt;Every time you log onto PayPal, you will need to enter a security code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-22/security_key.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An exercise in frustration!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say there are trade-offs between security and convenience. But some security does not need to come at the cost of all convenience. “Keep your money safer by turning off two-factor authentication because our iOS app does not support it and it’s really annoying on our website” says &lt;strong&gt;PayPal – a company that truly doesn’t care about your security.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The NEW iPad Mini 3</title>

   <updated>2014-10-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/10/16/the-new-ipad-mini-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, Apple unveiled new iPads. This included an update to the iPad Mini: the iPad Mini 3. The older iPad Mini 2 got a $100 price cut too. Now, let’s play a game. One year after the iPad Mini 2 was released, what’s new in the iPad Mini 3? Here is a picture compiled from the comparison chart Apple provides on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-16/ipad.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got to the end, and found that (aside from price) the only new thing in the iPad Mini 3 is Touch ID (Fingerprint identity sensor), you’ve won the game! Huzzah! Today felt more like a price-drop announcement for the iPad Mini 2 than the unveiling of a new and awesome iPad Mini 3.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>QR Codes Suck</title>
   <link href="/2014/10/06/qr-codes-suck/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/10/06/qr-codes-suck</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It could always get better, but as things stand right now, QR codes suck. Here’s my most recent &lt;strong&gt;GOD-AWFUL experience with QR codes&lt;/strong&gt;. I was at my favorite bubble tea place in the world: ShareTea in San Mateo. While waiting for my drink to be brought down from heaven by angels, I saw a sign posted on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-06/sharetea.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, “Aww yeah! I’ll follow you on Instagram.” I pulled out my iPhone, launched the Camera app, pointed it at the QR code, and waited. &lt;strong&gt;Nothing.&lt;/strong&gt; I launched Instagram, switched to camera mode, and repeated. &lt;strong&gt;Nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuff just isn’t right here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advertisement should include the Instagram username.&lt;/strong&gt; Seems pretty negligent to exclude it given how short usernames typically are: in this case shareteasanmateo. But isn’t the whole point of the QR code to eliminate the need for us to type out that username?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger issue here is &lt;strong&gt;built-in QR code support sucks.&lt;/strong&gt; It sucks on iOS. It sucks on Android. To read QR codes, you need to download an app… And there a ton of them! Seriously, I can google for the “best QR code reader on iOS [or Android],” and there are actually a plethora of relevant hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once I settled for an app, the experience did not really get any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-06/casinotea.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scanning the above QR code, I am taken to the ShareTea’s Instagram page in an embedded browser, featuring ads for some Zynga-esque casino game. And that’s it. I can’t hit the follow button because I’m not logged into Instagram in this embedded browser. I still don’t know the username because it’s no where to be found on the webpage – hats off to the Instagram team! I actually need to click on the URL and navigate to the end to see it. Then I need to do that click-hold gesture and drag to select just the username, copy it, open Instagram, paste it and FINALLY, I can follow ShareTea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did the QR code get me? &lt;strong&gt;Nothing.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not helpful. It’s not faster. It’s actually very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, the OS on my phone should recognize and parse a QR code into a common format (the hardest part here) that can &lt;strong&gt;do more than simply open a webpage&lt;/strong&gt;.  In that wonderful future, I would just launch the Camera app, point it at the QR code, the QR code would contain an app identifier (e.g Instagram), and metadata related to the end-goal (e.g. following ShareTea). The Camera app notifies me that the QR code wants to launch Instagram. If I accept, it takes me into the app, and then to the user’s page before finally asking me to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-10-06/qrface.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One day, those may be tears of happiness...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang in there QR codes! You suck now, but &lt;strong&gt;there is hope for the future&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Taste of Portugal</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/28/taste-of-portugal/"/>

   <id>/2014/09/28/taste-of-portugal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of people always ask me, “What do Portuguese people eat?” I usually just say, “We eat A LOT!” But for those unsatisfied with that answer, here are some of the things I ate during a recent visit to my Portuguese family in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/papo_seco.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Papo Seco com manteiga&lt;/strong&gt;- The Portuguese Roll (papo seco) is bread in its supreme form. My ideal Portuguese breakfast is a toasted and buttered (manteiga) Portuguese Roll with a glass of soy milk. Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/caldoverde.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caldo Verde&lt;/strong&gt; - A quintessential Portuguese dish consisting of potatoes, collard greens, and usually sausage (chouriço). This soup is normally served at parties and celebrations, but, growing up, my family served it at Sunday dinners. The soup pairs really well with broa (Portuguese cornbread), but I always ate mine with a Portuguese Roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/febras.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Febras com Cebolada&lt;/strong&gt; - A simple but wonderful dish. Pan-fried boneless pork cutlets served with sautéed onions and peppers. Once again, the almighty Portuguese Roll is an excellent vessel for serving this dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/arrozcabidela.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arroz de Cabidela&lt;/strong&gt; - My favorite way to cook rice: in the BLOOD OF CHICKENS! I’m not sure if this is simply a myth but they say this dish was inherited from the Sephardi Jews. Rather than twisting the neck of the chicken to kill it, the Sephardi Jews would slit the chicken’s throat and then hang it to drain the blood. Enterprising Portuguese realized you should not waste the blood and cooked the rice in it with a bit of vinegar. Morbid, but tasty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/acorda.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Açorda de Camarão&lt;/strong&gt; - My family is from the northwestern-most Alto Minho region of Portugal. But this dish is from the south-central Alentejo region. This dish may look like a huge mushy disaster, but it’s actually very tasty. The main ingredients are mashed bread and shrimp. Codfish/bacalhau is another common fish used in this dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/bacalhau_bras.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bacalhau à Brás&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s made with shredded pieces of codfish (bacalhau), onions, scrambled eggs, and french fries. I’m not usually a huge fan of codfish, but when this dish comes out, I am suddenly a huge fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/estufada.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carne de Vaca Estufada&lt;/strong&gt; - Another one of my favorite dishes is steamed (estufada) cow (vaca) meat (carne). This is commonly served with mashed potatoes and green peas. My mom also makes rice because my sister and dad don’t believe in mashed potatoes. I’m not sure what goes into making the marinade the meat rests in, but it goes so well as a gravy on the mashed potatoes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/pasteis.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pastel de Nata&lt;/strong&gt; - Custard cups are the perfect end to every meal. My Asian friends say these look a lot like Chinese Egg Tarts. Except (incoming UNBIASED Portuguese opinion) these are WAY BETTER!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s that. Suddenly overcome with saudades of Portuguese food, I need to go book a ticket to visit home again!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Laghdú Reviewed</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/20/laghdu-reviewed/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/20/laghdu-reviewed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During my visit to NJ, I convinced my former thesis advisor, Dan Trueman, that it’d be a good idea to hang out with me. He fell for it! A few days later, I sat in his office and we had a pleasant talk about all sorts of things. But at some point my eyes wandered to a beautiful folded piece of paper held together by two equally beautiful, yellow rubber bands. &lt;strong&gt;What is this wonderful machination?&lt;/strong&gt; I reached out for it. I was touching &lt;strong&gt;pure beauty&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan interrupted my special moment with the folded piece of paper. &lt;strong&gt;“That’s my new album.”&lt;/strong&gt; Dear God, Dan! You’re telling me this isn’t a gift from God?! It’s a music album?! I looked back at the album and noticed the two pairs of 10 lines. “It’s a collaboration between me and Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh.” Sounds Irish to me. You know what else is near Ireland? NORWAY! And you know what’s from Norway and has 10 strings? &lt;strong&gt;HARDANGER FIDDLES!&lt;/strong&gt; Dan seemed impressed by my deductive reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my mind had only begun to be blown. The paper felt Californian in nature – very, very recycled. “The album is very “green.” It uses soy-based inks on sustainable paper at a factory that produces its own electricity. Wowzers! But then Dan floored me. “The water leaving the plant is cleaner than it is when it enters.” Are you kidding me? This album is also helping the environment?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan told me I could have the copy with which I shared such an intimate moment… If I listened to it. I took it, admired it the entire way home, and then I listened to it. I’m not really good at explaining music, but &lt;strong&gt;I enjoyed it&lt;/strong&gt;. My favorite track was “What What What” because it has an awesome name, and it’s the track that I could best visualize Dan jamming out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may say physical media is dead, but not only is Laghdú a pleasure to listen to, it &lt;strong&gt;revived my faith in media physica&lt;/strong&gt;. The album comes out in a week on September 27th. You can order a copy of this majestic beauty from &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.irishmusic.net/album/laghd&quot;&gt;store.irishmusic.net&lt;/a&gt;. For those heathens not taken with the beauty of the album cover, there’s a digital option too. But you’re not a heathen, are you?!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Guessing the GSL Season 3 Champion</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/17/guessing-gsl-season-3-champion/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/17/guessing-gsl-season-3-champion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;GOM eXP -- the company that hosts Korea's StarCraft World Championship Series -- challenged fans to &lt;b&gt;guess which players Artosis and Tasteless predicted to win the tournament&lt;/b&gt;. Here's what they told us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Artosis and Tasteless made their predictions before the round of 16 began.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick one Zerg who couldn’t advance to the round of 8.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick one Protoss who did advance to the round of 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-17/ro16.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results from the round of 16 courtesy of Liquipedia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with sixteen potential candidates, but we can narrow down the choices down significantly. The Zergs who didn’t advance are &lt;strong&gt;Soulkey&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Effort&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt;. The Protoss who advanced were &lt;strong&gt;Zest&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Rain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Stats&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is &lt;strong&gt;Tasteless picked Effort&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Artosis picked Rain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasteless&lt;/strong&gt; has been super passionate about Effort who he says is back in “Brood War” shape. Tasteless is also a lot more passionate about Brood War because sometime recently he apparently lost his passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artosis&lt;/strong&gt; – a.k.a. Captain Safety – loves Rain’s super-safe play. Also, on the first day of the round of 8, Artosis has been saying Rain is going to make it to the finals and take it all. That said, he could just be trolling everyone…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Share your guess on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/officialeXP&quot;&gt;GOM eXP Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;tweet at me&lt;/a&gt; about how I lost my passion for writing sensical and relevant blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update!&lt;/strong&gt; I was half right. Artosis picked Rain, but Tasteless picked True!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Driving in New Jersey</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/15/nj-driving/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/15/nj-driving</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-15/nj_tp.png&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I was &amp;mdash; as one of my friends put it &amp;mdash; &quot;born, raised, and pretentiously educated in New Jersey&quot; before moving to California. It's been four years since I left the Garden State, but I come back pretty often to visit family. One of the best parts of visiting is being constantly reminded how &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; the typical New Jersey driver is, and how my own driving skills have degraded while being away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I don’t do quite as well anymore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tailgating. Together, we’re all Jersey Strong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make turns without a turn signal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Cutting people off&lt;/del&gt; Merging almost on top of someone next to me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Squeezing in between two cars; one of which is tailgating the other.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drive more &lt;del&gt;aggressively&lt;/del&gt; assertively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change lanes without a turn signal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See someone ahead trying to merge into my lane. Speed up quickly to block them from doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show off how long my middle finger is to fellow travelers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure my car horn works by using it every minute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to the honker behind me, by showing them how well my brakes work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing says “Welcome Home!” like driving in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do I Need a New Computer?</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/13/do-i-need-a-new-computer/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/13/do-i-need-a-new-computer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;Instead of assuming you do and spending a ton of money, &lt;strong&gt;ask yourself these three questions first&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does my computer turn on?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I have a solid-state drive (SSD)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I have enough memory/RAM?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/destroyed.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your laptop looks like this, you probably should get a new one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people’s computers are just fine.&lt;/strong&gt; But if your computer is damaged to the point where it won’t even power on or the display is not functional, you probably need a new computer. But if the chief complaint is how slow it is, you can usually alleviate that – at a fraction of the cost of a new computer – by exploring the second and third questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; - if your computer is slow and you don’t have an SSD and have not maxed out RAM, consider upgrading those before purchasing a new computer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ssd&quot;&gt;SSD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An SSD is the &lt;strong&gt;single best upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; you can get for your computer. Most computers you buy come with a traditional rotational hard drive (HDD). These drives work by writing and reading data, with a mechanical arm, on platters. These operations require spinning the platters and moving the arm around. Think of it like an old-school record player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/ssd.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Samsung 840 EVO is pretty well-regarded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HDDs are slow and are usually the bottleneck in your computer: every other component is simply faster. By &lt;strong&gt;upgrading to an SSD, you’ll get a snappier system&lt;/strong&gt;: the laptop will boot faster, applications will open faster, and your life in general will improve. This is because the write and read speeds of an SSD are significantly higher compared to an HDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering, “If SSDs are so much better than HDDs, why don’t all computers come with them?” Like most things in life the answer is &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt;. Per gigabyte, SSDs are more expensive than their rotational brethren. How much more expensive? Prices vary from drive to drive, but here’s an example. With a Western Digital 500 GB laptop HDD, you are paying &lt;strong&gt;$0.09 per gigabyte&lt;/strong&gt;. With a Samsung Evo 250 GB SSD, you are paying &lt;strong&gt;$0.51 cents per gigabyte&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s almost 6 times more expensive per gigabyte!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;Is it worth it? &lt;strong&gt;Yes it is!!!&lt;/strong&gt; Consider all these things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speed! Different tests produce different results, but SSDs are blazing fast. Some tests show SSDs being 10x faster than HDDs!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less noisy! HDDs have moving parts; SSDs do not. This means SSDs do not make noise from vibrations of moving parts, generate less heat, and use less power.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Magnet-safe! Magnets can actually destroy data on HDDs, but SSDs are impervious to magnets. Huzzah!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speed! Did I mention how fast they are already?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a 250 GB Samsung EVO SSD for $130. If you need a larger drive, a 500 GB SSD costs $250, and a 1 TB SSD costs $430.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize (hyperbole incoming): With an SSD, you will go from waiting on your computer, to having your computer wait on you! Check out this in-depth article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storagereview.com/ssd_vs_hdd&quot;&gt;SSDs vs. HDDs by Storage Review&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to know more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ram&quot;&gt;RAM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next is &lt;strong&gt;RAM.&lt;/strong&gt; When you open programs, they are loaded into RAM. If you open a lot of apps (or have very little RAM), your computer needs to move stuff out of RAM to make room for the new app. It does this by copying data from RAM to your HDD (or SSD). If you start using the app that was moved out, the computer swaps something else out and brings that app back into RAM. This swapping in and out is slow, especially if you have an old-school HDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/ram.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many types of RAM (e.g. DDR2, DDR3, PC3-8500, PC3-12800).&lt;br /&gt; Make sure you get the right one!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading to an SSD makes the swapping process faster, but not having to do the swapping in the first place is the best way to go. These days, &lt;strong&gt;4 GB of memory is recommended&lt;/strong&gt;, but &lt;strong&gt;you can’t go wrong with 8 GB or even 16 GB&lt;/strong&gt; if you’re doing a lot of multi-tasking. Look up how to measure “page ins” and “page outs” in your particular operating system. Page in and page outs are the formal name for the swapping process. A ton of page ins are okay, but if you have a comparable amount of page outs you could probably benefit from more RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/paging.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a Mac, open Activity Monitor to compare your page ins vs. page outs.&lt;br /&gt;If your page outs are significantly lower than your page ins, you're in good shape!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of different types of RAM and the price ranges vary somewhat. On average, you’ll pay about $10 per gigabyte of RAM, so 8 GB of RAM will cost about $80.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counterpoint----when-you-cant-or-shouldnt-upgrade&quot;&gt;Counterpoint – When You Can’t or Shouldn’t Upgrade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this advice isn’t all-encompassing as &lt;strong&gt;some laptops don’t have user-upgradeable hard drives or RAM&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, the newest line of Macbook Pros do not have user-upgradeable RAM. On the other hand, while the SSDs are not your standard 2.5-inch drives, they can be upgraded. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transcend-info.com/apple/jetdrive/&quot;&gt;Transcend&lt;/a&gt; makes JetDrive SSDs for these Apple machines that require quirky SSDs and the upgrade process is very straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can't upgrade your Mac to Snow Leopard (10.6), you can't install Google Chrome!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if your computer is ten years old, it probably isn’t worth upgrading. All the technology (beyond the HDD/SSD and RAM) in your machine is outdated. For example, older 32-bit CPUs cannot address more than 4 GB of RAM so you can’t upgrade beyond that. Also, you may be unable to upgrade your OS, and software manufactures may stop supporting your older OS. For example, Google Chrome for Mac requires Mac OS Snow Leopard. Snow Leopard requires an Intel CPU. If you have an older Mac that doesn’t have an Intel CPU, you can’t install Google Chrome. In cases like this, you shouldn’t invest in an SSD or more RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the types of HDD/SDD and RAM that are compatible with your machine may be so old, that manufacturers don’t produce as much (or any) of that item. Older versions of RAM, like DDR2, are actually more expensive than the newer DDR3 because DDR2 is no longer manufactured at a high rate (if at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to get 4-6 years out of most computers. These upgrades can make this period of time a happy reality. If you’re feeling the crunch and are thinking about upgrading to an SSD and more RAM, consider that a 250 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM will run you around $200, which is a lot cheaper than any new (and decent) computer! I’ve helped friends and family members with these upgrades. They are always amazed at the breath of new (and speedy) life given to what they thought was an “almost dead” computer. If you’re buying a computer that cannot be upgraded, it’s important to make sure you are leaving enough of a cushion so your computer lasts into the future: for example, buying more RAM than you think you might need right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious but have no idea what to do next, or want some personally-tailored advice, &lt;strong&gt;just let me know&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Since we’re talking about computers so much, remember to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.gg/2014/01/24/back-it-up/&quot;&gt;back it up&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 0.75em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Every situation is unique, and these suggestions might not apply to you specifically. Ask me or a professional if you aren’t sure! Also, I refer to laptops and computers interchangeably. This post focuses more on laptops; on a PC you can upgrade even more things that weren't discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Devious iPhone 6 Gigabytes</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/11/devious-iphone-6-gigabytes/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/11/devious-iphone-6-gigabytes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Storage capacities. That’s the deviously smart thing about the new iPhone 6 and larger-than-life iPhone 6 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-11/size.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So many gigabytes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “base” iPhone model has and still costs $199. Before the iPhone 6, the base iPhone model had 16 GB. You could &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt; the capacity to 32 GB for $100, and with another $100 you could &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt; that to 64 GB. With the new iPhone 6 models, you still pay $100 for capacity upgrades, but now your first $100 doesn’t double your capacity, it &lt;strong&gt;QUADRUPLES&lt;/strong&gt; it from 16 GB to 64 GB. Another $100 on top of that &lt;strong&gt;JUST doubles&lt;/strong&gt; the 64 GB to 128 GB. One day that second $100 will quadruple your 64 GB into a wonderful 256 GB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-11/appledoge.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the most devious thing is keeping the “base” iPhone 6 model at 16 GB and not making the “base” model have 32 GB in storage. It keeps costs down for Apple and will likely encourage  people to upgrade to that 64 GB model. If paying $100 to double your capacity didn’t seem appealing, paying $100 to quadruple your capacity will likely win more people over. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>GTFO GoToMeeting!</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/10/gtfo-gotomeeting/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/10/gtfo-gotomeeting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I dragged three different versions of GoToMeeting from my Applications folder to the trash. A few days later, I found myself deleting the same three copies of GoToMeeting  &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;. How did GoToMeeting reinstall itself? A few tweets to the helpful person behind @GoToMeeting confirmed my worst fears…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-10/reinstall.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoToMeeting runs a background agent that exists outside the app bundle and automatically updates itself. Turns out, it will also reinstall the app and it will even install three different versions of itself! &lt;strong&gt;How annoyingly convenient!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoToMeeting’s instructions for disabling automatic updates involve waiting for GoToMeeting to reinstall itself and then disabling automatic updates from within the app. &lt;strong&gt;I REFUSE!!!&lt;/strong&gt; I’m getting rid of this nuisance now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, cleaning up GoToMeeting permanently isn’t too difficult. It just requires killing a launch agent configuration file, but if you want to be thorough you can wipe the entire folder that contains the background updater. To the command-line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# if you like playing it safe, replace -f (force delete) with -i (interactive delete)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# delete the launch agent configuration file&lt;/span&gt;
rm -fv ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrixonline.GoToMeeting.G2MUpdate.plist

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# delete the folder that contains the background updater&lt;/span&gt;
rm -rfv ~/Library/Application&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;Support/CitrixOnline/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good riddance, GoToMeeting!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/2014/09/08/i-wanna-know-what-your-name-is</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to personalize my compliments on Yelp, but I don’t overdo it. I’ll take some base like “Have a great week” and just add the person’s name to it. I think referring to someone by their name is an easy way to add a little personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I hit the Compliment button on my iOS or Android device, I run into a little snag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-08/name.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I spell my girlfriend's name again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crap! I don’t remember the person’s name or how to spell it properly! And it’s no where on this compliment screen. This is especially common during a “Compliment Blitzkrieg” where I send a bunch of compliments at once and names are flying around everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. I could just go back, commit it to memory, and go back, but there is plenty of space on the compliment screen so it’d be nice if the person’s name was included. Here’s a mock-up (keyboard included!) of what it could look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-08/mock.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huzzah! That's how I spell her name!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yelp – you could be sparing tons of relationships (from casual to intimate) from incredible awkwardness here!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unbelievably Lazy Sex Robot</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/04/lazy-sex-robot/"/>

   <id>/2014/09/04/lazy-sex-robot</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It all started with a &lt;strong&gt;clearly unassuming&lt;/strong&gt; instant message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-04/robot.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, sex robot!? It’s been 17 years since AOL Instant Messenger was released, and this is your best shot? Referring to me as “stud &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; lovely lady” and then assuring me (with improper grammar to boot) that “this is really myself” is just unbelievably lazy. Or perhaps, like email spammers, the sex robots just want really gullible people to click on their links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there is something pretty cool (i.e. devious) going on here. The link to this sex robot’s website contains my username as the query string (e.g. www.spamwebsite.com/&lt;em&gt;?username&lt;/em&gt;). Anyone who clicks on the link will not only get some unwanted malware on their system, but will likely also get a little boost in their &lt;strong&gt;sex messaging susceptibility rating.&lt;/strong&gt; If I was a sex robot and was prioritizing who to send messages to, people who clicked on sex robot links in the past are much more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this sex robot isn’t so lazy after all…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Drivers Still Suck on Windows</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/02/drivers-still-suck-on-windows/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/02/drivers-still-suck-on-windows</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I used a Windows machine. While I do virtualize sometimes to run Windows-only software, I haven’t considered myself a Windows user since the summer of 2006 when I switched to a Mac. It’s been a while since I had to work with a Windows machine, but some things never change: &lt;strong&gt;driver installation is still a harrowing experience on Windows&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/guess.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Milk makes your bones stronger. Drivers make your Windows PC usable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend recently bought a Windows laptop (a Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284) and wanted me to help him set it up. Setting it up involved not paying Toshiba their exorbitant cost for an SSD and installing one ourselves, upgrading the RAM, and downgrading (i.e. upgrading) from Windows 8 to Windows 7. It was somewhat of a struggle but we were able to eventually take the machine apart, upgrade to an SSD, upgrade the RAM, “acceptably” put the machine back together, and install Windows 7. Yet, the real struggle hadn’t even begun…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A driver-less Windows machine is a pathetic thing. The display resolution is terrible, the trackpad is wonky, and connecting to a network with either Ethernet or Wi-Fi is impossible. Fortunately, laptop manufacturers have webpages for you to download drivers. Unfortunately, that’s where most of the good ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, downloading the driver for the Wi-Fi card presents me with the following options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/list.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How lucky are you feeling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welp, this is hard. Not only are there four &lt;strong&gt;different drivers for the same functional piece of hardware&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. Wi-Fi card), there are also &lt;strong&gt;multiple versions of some drivers&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m not quite sure why Toshiba doesn’t hide the older versions. Newer should always be better right? As luck would have it, my friend’s laptop had the Realtek driver which I downloaded last because it was at the end of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/mulan.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whooooooo makes that Wi-Fi card I cannot see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Internet connectivity, Windows Update helped me out and installed a bunch of the drivers, but there were a few stragglers left. So, back I went to Toshiba’s website for &lt;strong&gt;a game of cat-and-mouse trying to find the missing drivers&lt;/strong&gt;. An hour or so later, I was down to a single device – USB2.0-CRW – missing its driver. Some Google-fu revealed this was the multi-card reader, but &lt;strong&gt;nothing on Toshiba’s website seemed to work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered driver-installing-helping-software like Driver Easy and Driver Max that scan your computer for hardware and find the drivers for you. Huzzah! Sounds wonderful. I wish I had found it earlier! Driver Easy was easily (pun intended) able to find the USB2.0-CRW driver and install it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-09-02/drivermax.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only $19.90 a month to unlock the MAX!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly – and very maddening – Driver Easy also reported that most of the drivers I installed from Toshiba’s website were outdated. Cool! Let’s just update them all. What!? I need to buy a pro version of this software to get that awesome update all functionality? If you don’t pony up the cash not only do you not get that feature, &lt;strong&gt;Driver Max makes you wait 5+ minutes for each download&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Driver Easy limits your download speed to 30 KB/s.&lt;/strong&gt; Both applications also block you from downloading multiple drivers at once, so grab a drink or a few drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Xenoblade and the Nintendo 3DS++</title>
   <link href="/2014/08/30/xenoblade-nintendo-3ds-plus/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/08/30/xenoblade-nintendo-3ds-plus</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recent slew of announcements by Nintendo are tugging me in all sorts of directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m &lt;strong&gt;excited&lt;/strong&gt; that Nintendo is porting Xenoblade Chronicles to the 3DS. The limited run and subsequent limited supply of Xenoblade copies in the US has put the game out of reach for many. Since it’s a game that truly captivated me, I’m happy that tons of people will now have the chance to experience it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-30/xenoblade.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m kind of &lt;strong&gt;sad&lt;/strong&gt; that the port is going to the 3DS and not the Wii U. The upcoming spiritual successor to Xenoblade Chronicles, Xenoblade Chronicles X, is a Wii U exclusive and from what’s been shown already, the game looks beautiful. People who emulate the original Xenoblade say it looks great: definitely better than what you get with a Wii. There is even an HD texture project to enhance the visuals further. I was hoping Nintendo would build hype for the sequel by giving the original Xenoblade a great HD remaster and releasing it for the Wii U. In my wildest fantasies, a Wii U bundle would feature a Monado-esque Wii U Gamepad. Instead, Nintendo is going the opposite route and will likely have to make the game look less impressive than it was on the Wii.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-30/xenopad.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A boy can dream of wielding a Monado-WiiU-Gamepad!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m a bit &lt;strong&gt;confused&lt;/strong&gt; with the news that the port of Xenoblade Chronicles will only run on a “new” 3DS – henceforth referred to as the 3DS++ – because it will require more RAM and CPU to run properly. The 3DS++ also adds an extra pair of shoulder buttons and a circle pad on the right side near the ABXY buttons. But what happens next? How is Nintendo going to effectively explain this fragmentation in its hardware to your average customer? I doubt developers will only develop for the 3DS++ and abandon the existing (and massive) 3DS market. But then what kind of allure will the 3DS++ itself have when it can only claim to run a few games that the 3DS cannot? Will developers spend resources to make the 3DS++ version of their game look nicer and take advantage of the extra inputs? Maybe, if the proper incentives (e.g. lots of money from Nintendo) are there. All in all, I’m excited about new hardware, but a bit irked by Nintendo messing with the massively successful 3DS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GUl1EkUJ46k?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m &lt;strong&gt;pumped&lt;/strong&gt; that Shulk is going to be in the new Super Smash Bros. THIS IS THE POWER OF THE MONADO! I only wish Reyn could also be added so I can hear “IT’S REYN TIME” over and over again ad infinitum… Oooor maybe it’s better to leave him out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such emotions. Much range. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don't Ask Me Stupid Questions</title>

   <id>/2014/08/24/dont-ask-me-stupid-questions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I always tell people who warn me that they’re about to ask a stupid question, that there’s no such thing as a stupid question. But when a computer asks me a stupid question, I show no mercy. One of the many chat clients installed on my iPhone – WeChat – recently asked me a supremely stupid question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-24/question.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid may be a bit harsh, but this (automated) message I got from the WeChat Team has a misguided focus. The WeChat Team wants me to get excited about all the new features in version 5.4, yet my initial reaction when I saw this message was, “Am I on version 5.4?” Turns out I already was, but I still got a message asking me if I had upgraded. And WeChat knows I had already upgraded because the client-side app could very easily notify their servers of the app version running on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message could’ve been more like “You’re riding in WeChat 5.4. It has all these awesome features we think you should use right now!” And if I wasn’t on 5.4, the messaging could’ve been more encouraging for me to upgrade: “WeChat 5.4 has a ton of awesome features; upgrade today to gain access to all of them and your life will be a million times more awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, a missed opportunity…&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Warp Gate Technology is the biggest must-have upgrade in all of StarCraft. For 50 minerals and 50 gas, you can convert your Gateways into Warpgates. This allows you to rapidly (in 5 seconds) warp in units ANYWHERE you have pylon coverage. It also reduces the overall time it takes to build units; Zealots can be warped in every 28 seconds, whereas Warpgates take 38 seconds to build one. Unless you’re Zealot-rushing or going mass Air Toss, there really is no good reason to avoid researching Warp Gate Technology. Warpgates are simply better in every single way compared to Gateways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I wonder if we could make the Gateway vs. Warpgate decision more interesting because right now, it’s a no-brainer. Here are some (potentially game-destroying) thoughts. The general principle is how we can we make Gateways more attractive and/or make Warpgates less attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units built from Gateways could be slightly cheaper or units built from Warpgates could be slightly more expensive. Make the price of warp-ins more than absolutely free after an investment of just 50 minerals and 50 gas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units warped in via Warpgates could be warped in with 50% shields. Blah, blah, blah the warp-in process is painful and damages a unit’s shields.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of having Warpgates be able to produce units faster, reduce the unit build times so Gateways can produce units faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These may all be dangerous (some may call them stupid) ideas, but I think making the decision between Gateways versus Warpgate not so incredibly obvious would actually be pretty cool. Regardless, Protoss would still be super OP and would still only require A-moving to win games…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Let's Crunch Intelligence Squared</title>
   <link href="/2014/08/08/lets-crunch-intelligence-squared/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/08/08/lets-crunch-intelligence-squared</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence Squared US&lt;/strong&gt; is a cool debate series I listen to on NPR every so often. Debate topics include “Death Is Not Final” and “Russia Is A Marginal Power.” Debates feature two sides: one for the motion and one against the motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience is polled on their opinion before and after the debate; they can vote for the motion, against the motion, or be undecided. The winner of the debate is whichever side has the largest increase in percentage points. So if the split is 70/20/10 (for / against / undecided) before the debate and 72/25/3 after the debate, the against side wins because they increased by 5 points, whereas the for side only gained 2 points. Winning usually boils down to whoever can sway the most undecided voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day a friend observed that, “I’ve listened to dozens of episodes, and not once has the number of unsure audience members increased.” While it seems intuitive to me that fewer people would be undecided after hearing an extended discussion on a topic, I can also see where his confusion comes from. If you hear people present compelling arguments for two sides of a topic, it should have the power to convince some that their former positions may be incorrect – maybe even sway some to decide that they are now undecided. I suppose people dislike NOT having an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of disappointed friend, who also happens to be a data scientist, then crunched some numbers and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://havingneweyes.com/2014/07/27/intelligence-squared-debates-voting-data/&quot;&gt;spectacular write-up&lt;/a&gt; with some pretty interesting finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said data scientist inputted all data into Google Spreadsheets before crunching some conclusions out, but &lt;strong&gt;I’m a JSON-type-of-guy&lt;/strong&gt;. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/intelligence-json&quot;&gt;intelligence-json&lt;/a&gt;: a repository containing all results of Intelligence Squared US debates in JSON format. Also enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/intelligence-analyzer&quot;&gt;intelligence-analyzer&lt;/a&gt;: a skeleton project that parses all this data into POJOs using Jackson, my favorite JSON parsing library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crunch away friends!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Child of Light</title>
   <link href="/2014/08/02/child-of-light/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/08/02/child-of-light</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holy crap! I totally forgot about the July 1st release of &lt;strong&gt;Child of Light&lt;/strong&gt; on the Vita until it flew right by me. After finally playing it, I’m happy to report that it’s a surprisingly unique and amazing JRPG! Here’s a list of what makes Child of Light truly shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-02/pretty.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such beauty. Much impress. Wow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art&lt;/strong&gt; - Damn, this game is freaking gorgeous. I am no connoisseur of art, but the “watercolor magic art stuff” they used for this game is so pleasant on the eyes. The wide array of environments (e.g. forest, desert, seaside village) and diversity of characters (more on that soon) all contribute to an aesthetically beautiful game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-02/battle.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grandia fans will feel right at home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle system&lt;/strong&gt; - The system inherits A LOT from Grandia’s awesome battle system. You basically have a timeline that everyone travels along. During the “wait” period you can’t do anything; you wait. At the junction between “wait” and “cast” you pick your action. Then you begin casting the action. The key here is that actions do not happen instantaneously. If you are attacked while casting, you will be interrupted and your action will be cancelled. The same tactic can be used to keep enemies interrupted. The key to dominating battles is to interrupt enemy attacks and avoid getting your actions interrupted. Unlike some JRPGs where you can grind and brute force your way through battles, this system greatly rewards tactical play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-02/scary.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, the world needs saving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story&lt;/strong&gt; - Yes, like your typical JRPG you’re going to have to save the world, but the story has a very dark fairy tale feel to it. It’s so much a fairy tale that there is even rhyming! The story isn’t very engrossing, but fortunately, it also didn’t detract from the enjoyable gameplay. The plot was simple and character motivations were simple, which ended up being a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-02/skit.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little skits give characters some more... character.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters&lt;/strong&gt; - The ragtag cast of characters in this game is truly delightful. The main character might be your typical young damsel in distress, but everyone who tags along for the ride is unique in all senses of the word. You have a jester (healer), a golem (melee), a gnome-man-thing (mage), a mouse-merchant (archer), and a fish-person (time mage). There isn’t huge character development, but there are short skits between two characters. Swapping characters out in battle is straightforward and encouraged since certain characters fair better against certain enemies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-08-02/characters.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen, Golem, Óengus, and Robert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt; - Man, I love the music from this game. Composed by the Canadian singer-songwriter Cœur de Pirate, the music perfectly compliments the game’s atmosphere. Just give it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://musique.coeurdepirate.com/album/child-of-light&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child of Light is available on pretty much everything (PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, Vita) so if you’re craving a JRPG to play, &lt;strong&gt;I highly recommend this gem&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Futurama - An Eye for the Details</title>
   <link href="/2014/07/26/futurama-an-eye-for-the-details/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/07/26/futurama-an-eye-for-the-details</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I appreciate an eye for the details, even when they may appear to be so minor or inconsequential. I recently revisited the pilot episode of Futurama where Fry – on December 31, 1999 – is transported 1000 years into the future. Later on in the episode, his newfound robot friend Bender says they can hide in a museum because “it’s free on Tuesdays.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-26/free_on_tuesdays.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My trusty general-purpose calculator Wolfram Alpha confirms that December 31, 2999 is in fact a Tuesday. Yes, it’s a small detail. Yes, they could’ve just picked a random day and hoped they were right. But caring enough to get this small detail right is pretty dang cool.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Please Take My Money Sony</title>
   <link href="/2014/07/20/please-take-my-money-sony/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/07/20/please-take-my-money-sony</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Man, I can’t believe I’m saying this but &lt;strong&gt;SONY, PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY&lt;/strong&gt;. I was just trying to buy some video games in the PlayStation Store. When I was adding funds to my account, I kept getting an error when inputting my credit card details: “please enter a valid credit card number.” Double-checked the number, the expiration date, the security code, and name on the credit card and tried again. &lt;strong&gt;ERROR&lt;/strong&gt;. Double-checked my billing address. &lt;strong&gt;ERROR&lt;/strong&gt;. What’s going on, Sony!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After digging around online, I find I’m not the only person with credit card input issues on Sony’s website. After a ton of “me too, I hate Sony” posts, I found a helpful netizen who suggested making sure the billing address inputted on Sony’s website EXACTLY matches your credit card’s billing address. Now I can understand having to get a billing address correct when authorizing a transaction, but Sony is handling this somewhat poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if there is an error with my billing address, don’t tell me to “enter a valid credit card number.” Tell me to check the actual issue: the billing address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Sony has to loosen up their billing address verification. For example, let’s say my address is 120 Lombard Street / Apt G (the slash indicates the separation from the first and second address line). For some reason, my credit card company swaps these two lines and lists my billing address has APT G / 120 LOMBARD ST. Here’s what Sony does not accept:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;120 LOMBARD STREET / APT G&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;120 LOMBARD ST / APT G&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;120 LOMBARD ST APT G / [blank]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Sony will accept:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;APT G / 120 LOMBARD ST - exactly as listed on my credit card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apt G / 120 Lombard St - case insensitive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apartment G / 120 Lombard Street - abbreviations (e.g. ST and APT) can be expanded&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;APT G 120 LOMBARD ST / [blank] - lines 1 and 2 can be combined onto a single line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;APT [unit purposefully omitted] / 120 Lombard Street - what apartment doesn’t matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, this isn’t totally unreasonable on Sony’s part, but it seems kind of silly that when it comes to address lines, order REALLY matters. Other websites don’t care about order of the address lines, and gas stations only care about the zip code. Loosen up a bit, Sony!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, now that I’ve pontificated thoroughly on this issue, I’ll definitely remember the next time I run into issues spending money with Sony.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shame on Yelp, See What I Did There?</title>
   <link href="/2014/07/14/shame-on-yelp/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/07/14/shame-on-yelp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yelp, we’ve got a problem. A serious problem. I really like what you’re doing, but you should know that &lt;strong&gt;commas cannot join two sentences&lt;/strong&gt;. Yet every time someone sends a friend request, the placeholder sentence is a classic example of a comma splice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-14/spliced.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That comma should be a period or a semicolon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already shed enough tears on behalf of the English language when I read some people’s reviews. Yelp, please do your part and stop this unnecessary propagation of terrible grammar. Your community will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Also, tell your engineers that they really should get around to replacing “&lt;strong&gt;[link to your page]&lt;/strong&gt;” with the actual link to my page. iOS developers can check out the stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString method and Android developers can use the replace method. Happy coding fellow developers!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tales of Awesome</title>
   <link href="/2014/07/10/tales-of-awesome/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/07/10/tales-of-awesome</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Namco’s Tales series has been one of the most consistent JRPG franchises. My first taste was in 2004 with Tales of Symphonia, and that was a wonderful experience. I haven’t played every game in the series (there are a few duds it seems), but since Symphonia, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed Abyss, Vesperia, Graces, and most recently, Xillia. In a month, Tales of Xillia 2 will be released. I found Xillia to be a solid entry and the sequel is very, very well-regarded. RPG Fan has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpgfan.com/previews/Tales_of_Xillia_2/&quot;&gt;great preview&lt;/a&gt; on the game; here are my main (and somewhat irreverent) takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ludger [the protagonist] can switch between three weapon types (dual blades, a hammer, and a gun) to fight his enemies effectively at any distance.”&lt;/em&gt; Finally! Some game designer realized that the best weapon isn’t a sword, or even two swords, but two swords, a sledgehammer, AND dual-wielded pistols. Genius!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/weapons.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where will cosplayers keep the extra weapons?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“He can also transform into a demi-humanoid using the power of ‘Chromatus,’ dramatically augmenting his strength and ability repertoire.”&lt;/em&gt; Yes!!! Not only does he wield three different kinds of weapons, he can also GO SUPER SAIYAN!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/saiyan.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just SAIYAN!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Double Raid Linear Motion Battle System (DR-LMBS) returns as well.”&lt;/em&gt; The awesome battle system in the Tales series is a cornerstone of the series, but I never realized how ridiculous they name the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/battle.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Double Raid...ehh, screw it. This is the battle system in action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ludger and Elle are injured during a train hijacking early in the game, and a mysterious man takes advantage of their plight by paying their medical bills and putting Ludger into astronomical debt.”&lt;/em&gt; Sounds like Ludger and Elle don’t live on Elympios, but in the United States of America given the ruinous amount of medical debt they were able to incur. Running with that theory, it also sounds like the TSA should start securing our train systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/debt.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 million gald!? They must've spent a week and a half in the hospital!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irreverence aside, August 19th can’t come soon enough because I’m super excited to dive in Tales of Xillia 2.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ChucK Meets Travis</title>
   <link href="/2014/07/06/chuck-meets-travis/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/07/06/chuck-meets-travis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ge, Spencer, and I sometimes talk about our dreams when we’re playing StarCraft. During the small windows of time when we’re not playing StarCraft, we’re all making some sort of headway towards our dreams. Today, one of those dreams has come to pass. &lt;strong&gt;ChucK is now set up for continuous integration on Travis.&lt;/strong&gt; Every commit to ChucK triggers Travis to check that ChucK compiles and passes a suite of unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-06/madness.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who’s Travis? Travis is a free (for public repositories) hosted continuous integration service. With zero knowledge of Travis (but plenty of tears shed dabbling in release engineering at Smule), it only took an hour to get everything set up and running. You add one file to your repository (.travis.yml) and set up your scripts in there; it’s straightforward and &lt;strong&gt;just works&lt;/strong&gt;. They say you get what you pay for, so I feel kind of bad because Travis is so good I feel like someone is getting robbed. How good is it? It builds and tests pull requests! Gone are the days where you would have to meticulously review the changes you were about to pull into your project. If Travis THINKS it’s okay, you KNOW it’s okay. But, perhaps double-checking isn’t a bad idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-07-06/travis_1604.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;travis.yml file that supports both Linux and Mac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis has a multi-platform feature that’s in beta, and we’re already taking full advantage of that to run our tests on both Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) and Mac (Mavericks 10.9.2). When Travis  adds more platform and OS configurations, we’ll run (not walk) to get those configurations set up. And while the current 150+ tests are a great start for unit testing, we’re looking to expand testing to make it more thorough and exhaustive. ChucK has a pretty awesome user community that is good at pushing ChucK to the limits (and occasionally breaking it), so we see a future filled with more tests, and consequently a greater and more stable (i.e. more stable than incredibly stable) ChucK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want more? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/ccrma/chuck&quot;&gt;ChucK on Travis&lt;/a&gt;, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ccrma/chuck&quot;&gt;ChucK on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, read all about ChucK on its  &lt;a href=&quot;http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/community/&quot;&gt;join the ChucK community&lt;/a&gt;. **Happy ChucKing you motherchuckers! **&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;2014/06/10/ios-keyboard-woes/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; pointing out (i.e. complaining about) how iOS 7 broke the keyboard’s shift key. A coworker pointed out that the shift key really didn’t break in iOS 7 (released September 2013), but rather in iOS 7.1 (released March 2014). Android aside, I think iOS 6 still has the best shift key, but iOS 7.0’s shift key at least makes some sense. Here is a more complete picture depicting the shift key’s deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see how much “better” they make the shift key in iOS 8!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Playing Naughty with Facebook's Slingshot</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The new Facebook Slingshot app is like SnapChat with a twist: you can only see a photo or video someone has sent if you if send them something back first. It’s pretty cool. I’m not here to wax poetic about the potential merits of the “send me content back or you can’t see what I sent you” mechanic, but I do get slightly irked when I take all of &lt;strong&gt;5 seconds&lt;/strong&gt; to craft a crappy SnapChat only to NEVER hear back from the poor sap who wasted 10 seconds looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest question about Slingshot is: can we just bypass this whole locked content stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-06-22/locked.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out you can. Just configure your device to use an SSL proxy like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlesproxy.com/&quot;&gt;Charles Proxy&lt;/a&gt; and check out the calls made to &lt;strong&gt;https://api.parse.com/update&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;https://api.parse.com/client_function&lt;/strong&gt;. Look in the JSON array keyed by “lockedShotUsers” and you should see something like this. Note: the JSON body was trimmed to just show the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;lockedShotUsers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is a video taken by my mentor and hero, Tom Lieber a.k.a. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alltom.com&quot;&gt;alltom.com&lt;/a&gt;, playing Super Smash Bros. Yes, I didn’t reply to him. Yes, he called me a cheater and made me feel a little bad about this breach of Slingshot etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this matter? Not really. You could make it so the content URL isn’t sent down until you send content to someone else, but you don’t get a lot by cheating here. You’ll see what your friend sent you and have a little evil laugh. The main operating principle for the system still holds – if you want more content, you’re gonna have to make and share content. But if a friend says send me a picture of your credit card and I promise to send a picture of mine to unlock yours, you may want to ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>E3 2014 Postmortem</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/16/e3-2014-postmortem/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/16/e3-2014-postmortem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;E3 2014 has come and gone. A lot of exciting announcements were made by console juggernauts - Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo - and big publishers like EA and Ubisoft. A lot of exciting games were revealed as well. People craving information on an upcoming game that they’ve been looking forward to may have gotten some information to kindle even more excitement. Everyone has their opinion as to who put on the best show at E3. The victor in my eyes was easy to choose because &lt;strong&gt;Nintendo absolutely killed it this year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a vague 2015 release window for what should be an amazing JRPG, &lt;strong&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles X&lt;/strong&gt;, as well a ridiculous amount of gameplay footage. The 30-second teaser for a new open-world (Skyrim-esque) &lt;strong&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/strong&gt; for the Wii U has me shaking at the knees. There’s also a new &lt;strong&gt;Star Fox&lt;/strong&gt; and a totally brand-new IP, &lt;strong&gt;Splatoon&lt;/strong&gt;, that looks very, very fun and has the potential to ruin many friendships, like the also announced &lt;strong&gt;Mario Party 10&lt;/strong&gt;. The user-content-generating &lt;strong&gt;Mario Maker&lt;/strong&gt; could add nearly infinite replay-ability to the classic platformer. In addition to &lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire&lt;/strong&gt; which will likely sell like hotcakes, &lt;strong&gt;Code Name S.T.E.A.M.&lt;/strong&gt; is another game to keep an eye out for. Made by Intelligent Systems (the team behind Advance Wars) with some serious involvement from Hitoshi Yamagami (Xenoblade, Fire Emblem, Pokemon), this new game has an all-star cast working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the list of announcements, I discovered even more exciting stuff that I missed during Nintendo’s magical barrage of wonderful news. It’s looking like Nintendo is finally firing on all cylinders (except Metroid!) to make the Wii U a strong contender in the latest console war, while also bolstering the already-strong 3DS library.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>iOS Keyboard Woes</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/10/ios-keyboard-woes/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/10/ios-keyboard-woes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m sad to say my wildest WWDC fantasy did not come true last week. After Tim Cook and team unveiled a slew of new APIs, a new programming language, OS X Yosemite, and iOS 8, which includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/quicktype/&quot;&gt;a new, cooler keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, I was hoping the time of reckoning was upon us. Alas, I was wrong. &lt;strong&gt;iOS 8 does not fix the keyboard’s shift key.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! What’s wrong with the shift key? I’ll tell you what. I’m having a hard time determining when the shift key is on or off. Think I’m making this up? Give it a shot yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-06-10/quiz.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is shift key enabled on the left or right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: the shift key is enabled on the left, disabled on the right. I asked some friends and coworkers and I’m not the only one who got this question wrong. What’s most upsetting and downright disappointing is things were a lot better in iOS 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-06-10/ios6-comparison.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a lot easier on iOS 6.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy. It’s on when it’s lit up, and it’s off when it’s not. But you know what’s even better than iOS 6? Here comes a &lt;strong&gt;special&lt;/strong&gt; moment where Android does something better than iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-06-10/android-comparison.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shockingly and amazingly straightforward!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Android, there isn’t just one key to tell you if the shift key is enabled. When the shift key is enabled all alphabetical characters become capitalized. It’s actually “what you see is what you get.” It’s much more unambiguous and it’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wells… There’s always iOS 9.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Initial Impressions &mdash; Heroes of the Storm</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/08/initial-impressions-heroes-of-the-storm/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/08/initial-impressions---heroes-of-the-storm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-06-08/heroes_logo.jpg&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I spent a bunch of time this weekend checking out the Alpha of Blizzard's upcoming multiplayer online battle arena game (MOBA), Heroes of the Storm. I know the general idea behind this genre, but I've actually never played a MOBA, so you can say this weekend was my virginal MOBA experience. Here are some of my initial impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The game is fun!&lt;/strong&gt; Generally, I had a great time playing. The game is accessible, enjoyable, challenging, and addictive. I mostly played AI comp stomps; playing against other people made the game much more brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The maps are really cool.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not sure how other MOBAs work, but every map in Heroes has a different gameplay mechanic that can and should be leveraged to gain a large tactical advantage. For example, on Dragon Shire, a party that can simultaneously control two shrines can then summon a powerful Dragon hero that marches towards the enemy’s camp. It’s refreshing to see maps that differ in more ways than simply their texture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-06-08/heroes_blackheartbay.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The loading screen explains the map-specific mechanic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick-up groups suck!&lt;/strong&gt; This is a team game; it requires some amount of coordination. Playing with random people, it seemed like everyone was just doing their own thing. If our opponents had even a MINIMAL amount of coordination, we got totally wrecked. It reminded me a lot of a 4v4 in StarCraft where everyone just does their own build and everyone hopes it works out in the end. Sometimes it does, but most of the time it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have no idea what I’m doing.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m kind of figuring out what to do and find myself sometimes being a good team player, but – generally – I still have no idea what I’m doing. Fortunately, this can be remedied by playing more frequently, and playing with people who can show you the ropes. This is mostly just an apology to all my MOBA-playing friends who I will invariably frustrate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m eagerly anticipating the release of Heroes, mostly because that means I’ll be able to cajole four other friends to play with me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Kicking the Tires with PayPal</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/04/kicking-the-tires-with-paypal/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/04/kicking-the-tires-with-paypal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, Apple announced that Touch ID APIs would be available for use by third party developers. These new APIs allow developers to use the fingerprint identity sensor to authenticate users. Curiously enough, Paypal has come forward to inform us that their developers attended a session on integrating Touch ID into their app. A source at Paypal is quoted saying, “It seems to be a fairly easy API to use, but we’re still kicking the tires” in a Business Insider article.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking the tires? Before you start questioning the quality of this new API or even contemplating integration, why don’t you reflect on the current state of your iOS app? I have two-factor authentication enabled on my PayPal account. After all, I don’t want ONLY a password to be between a bad person and my bank account. But guess what happens when I try to log into PayPal on my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-06-04/pathetic.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is pathetic.png.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you kidding me?&lt;/strong&gt; I actually need to choose between having two-factor authentication or having access to PayPal on my mobile device. Why would a company, which deals with a person’s finances, put their customers in this kind of position? Why would they implement a security feature, but not support it across all platforms? Why don’t you “kick the tire” on your existing subpar (very generous by the way) app before you even start contemplating adding the bells and whistles of Touch ID?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Say Hello to the New Sing! on Android</title>
   <link href="/2014/05/28/say-hello-to-the-new-sing-on-android/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/05/28/say-hello-to-the-new-sing-on-android</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings &lt;em&gt;Sing! Karaoke&lt;/em&gt; Android people! This is Mark, Engineer-Progenitor of Smule’s &lt;em&gt;Sing!&lt;/em&gt; Android app. Since we first released our debut version of Sing! Android in December 2012, over 4 million of you have played with our app. Today, we’re proud to announce that we haven’t, in fact, been sitting on our thumbs for the past few months. The entire team here at Smule HQ has been hard at work making &lt;em&gt;Sing!&lt;/em&gt; for Android even better. To find out how we’ve improved &lt;em&gt;Sing!&lt;/em&gt;, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-05-28/new_icon.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new Sing! Karaoke!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; This post is featured on the Smule blog. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.smule.com&quot;&gt;blog.smule.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about what’s going on at Smule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Smule, we believe change is good. That’s why we’ve given Sing! for Android a major facelift — designed to make it easier for you to get around, explore and discover new ways to Sing! For example, the previous version of the app used a tab bar on the bottom of the screen for navigation. Now, there is a navigation drawer, which also has other things for you to explore, like hot Open Mic performances and recent performances by your friends. Browsing performances has also become a lot more streamlined. Now, when you select a performance, a little bar slides up from the bottom and starts playing it, allowing you to continue browsing other performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-05-28/browsing.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more streamlined performance-browsing experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core singing experience has also gotten a makeover to make it more streamlined. Long gone are the days when you needed to wait for your performance to render whenever you adjusted voice volume, changed effects, or updated delay calibration. Now, everything will automatically re-render at the current playback location and resume playback. And just like NASA, Smule has also abandoned our space shuttle – the little one that indicates your pitch level – and replaced it with a simpler triangle because the astronauts in our space shuttle missed their family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-05-28/singing.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The core singing experience gets a design update and lots of optimizations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major re-designs are always challenging. Engineers need to find new ways to introduce bugs. Testers try to break things. And project managers wring their hands over deadlines. It’s a crazy time for everyone, but we think you’ll like what we came up with: a new and beautiful &lt;em&gt;Sing! Karaoke&lt;/em&gt; for Android. We hope you enjoy it. Sing on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smule.singandroid&quot;&gt;Download Sing! Karaoke now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

But when I want amazing &lt;strong&gt;soft-serve ice cream&lt;/strong&gt;, you know where I go? &lt;strong&gt;McDonald’s&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes - you heard right! There are plenty of froyo places, and plenty of hard-serve ice cream places, but there are not enough places to &lt;strong&gt;SATISFY MY ADDICTION TO SOFT-SERVE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-05-14/smule-train.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Smule Soft-Serve Train at McDonald's. All aboard!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the Bay Area locations I know of that make soft-serve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bi-Rite Creamery&lt;/strong&gt; - Dishes out some pretty good soft-serve, with a nice selection of flavors that changes everyday. But they don’t really take soft-serve seriously. They have two locations, yet only serve soft-serve at one. And the soft-serve window has shorter hours than the regular ice cream. Talk about DISRESPECT!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Duper&lt;/strong&gt; - You can get decent burgers, shakes, and soft-serve here. They have Vanilla and Chocolate flavors, the soft-serve is made with Strauss Organic Milk, and they can dip your cone in chocolate. Yet, friends and I agree that the soft-serve just isn’t amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Food (McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, Wienerschnitzel)&lt;/strong&gt; - When it comes to availability, nothing beats fast food. Fast food joints everywhere offer soft-serve. Some soft-serve aficionado colleagues of mine did some taste tests, and we agree – McDonald’s is the King of Fast Soft-Serve. It’s not organic, and it might be made by mixing some dairy-esque powder and water, but their soft-serve is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see how &lt;strong&gt;SHORT&lt;/strong&gt; this list is? It’s &lt;strong&gt;PATHETIC&lt;/strong&gt;! It’s an &lt;strong&gt;EPIDEMIC&lt;/strong&gt; and lovers of soft-serve are suffering dearly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-05-14/addict.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An addict enjoying a waffle cone with some delicious Vanilla Soft-Serve in NJ!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point of comparison? I’m visiting my parents, who live in the lush, green suburbs of New Jersey. There are TWO soft-serve places near us that both dish out creamy, flavorful goodness. One of them even has waffle cones, chocolate-dipped waffle cones, and RAINBOW SPRINKLES. Bay Area – you know stuff’s bad when I can’t even find a place to sprinkle some rainbow on my soft-serve. But no one worry: I’m a problem-solver. Once I’ve had my fill of this programming stuff, I’m buying a soft-serve ice cream truck!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Final Fantasy X|X-2 Remaster is Amazing</title>
   <link href="/2014/05/08/ffx-remaster-is-amazing/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/05/08/ffx-remaster-is-amazing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-05-08/ffx-hd.jpg&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I rarely replay games.&lt;/strong&gt; My video game backlog is huge, and I've come to terms that some games just aren't going to get played until I retire to my parent's basement and live out the remaining days of my life as a quiet, video-game-pounding nerd. Even with the weight of a massive backlog on my shoulders, replaying Final Fantasy X and X-2 has been a wonderful experience. A lot of love was put into this remaster. Square Enix didn't just bump the polygon count, slap HD on the cover art, and ship it. This is a &lt;strong&gt;true remaster&lt;/strong&gt;, including a remastered soundtrack for FFX that I really enjoyed given my passion for video game music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People knock both games.&lt;/strong&gt; FFX is hated for the childish and whiney Tidus. The awkward laughing scene is ALWAYS brought up when people make fun of FFX, yet it isn’t awkward at all if properly contextualized. Yet despite all these supposed flaws, FFX tells a wonderful and heartbreaking story, with amazing gameplay to back it up. FFX-2 gets knocked for being too much like Charlie’s Angels set in the Final Fantasy universe. Yet, the game takes many brave departures from the prequel and executes well across the board. Following Yuna as she struggles to come to terms with the loss of Tidus, in a world she radically changed with his help, and the hope that she may find him again makes for an interesting story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like JRPGs and never played FFX or FFX-2, go get a copy of the remaster now! Playing both the PS3 and PS Vita version, I found myself playing on the Vita a lot more. Yes, the PS3 version looks a bit nicer, but the Vita version actually looks great. There is cross-save functionality so you can switch between the two if you want to play on both platforms. Some would think I would regret spending valuable video-game-playing-time revisiting Spira, but &lt;strong&gt;I have ZERO regrets about replaying both of these gems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe today marks a year since my first blog post. I originally started blogging to improve and refine my writing chops, and to rant about things like work, video games, food, and fitness. It’s been a busy year, with a whopping &lt;strong&gt;54 blog posts&lt;/strong&gt; (one per week!). Some months were very busy (10 posts in July), while others were likely filled with extreme video gaming (only one post in November). Here’s to another year filled with interesting experiences and waxing on poetic about them!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I Do Email</title>
   <link href="/2014/04/30/how-i-do-email/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/04/30/how-i-do-email</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;We're drowning in email. Good people look like terrible people when they can't keep afloat when hit by wave after relentless wave of email. Everyone has a strategy for dealing with email. Some people just don't care, and getting a timely reply (or a reply at all) from them is a matter of luck. Some people, like robots, manage email with a furious efficiency. I like to believe I've come up with a halfway decent strategy to managing email. Generally, my strategy has two goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Minimize the amount of mail that reaches my inbox.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2. Track emails that require future attention.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out how I beat back the evil of too much freaking email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I use Gmail and some Gmail-specific functionality. If you don’t use Gmail, this may not directly apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-30/filters.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abusing Gmail's Filters to keep the inbox less busy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I &lt;strong&gt;minimize the amount of email that actually reaches my inbox&lt;/strong&gt;. Why? Because if something hits my inbox (and I subsequently get a push notification on my phone), I want the message to actually be important. This is less about keeping up with email and more about disconnecting a little more from the constant connectedness everyone is subjected to these days. I abuse Gmail’s Filters and Labels. Anytime, something lands in my inbox that I feel should not have landed there, I update my Filters to grab those emails, automatically label them, and have them bypass my inbox. The image above shows how ridiculous this has become, but it’s good at keeping stuff out of my inbox. This seems to be where Gmail wants to go with its new inbox tabs (e.g. Primary, Social, Promotions), but this solution lets me have complete control over the filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of labels for Smule stuff, a Money label for financial stuff, and the general Non-Critical label that grabs everything else. &lt;strong&gt;If it’s important, it should land in my inbox. If it’s not, it can wait until later.&lt;/strong&gt; Since I started hardcore-filtering, I went from 30+ emails landing in my inbox everyday to less than 10. And no one has yet to complain (to me at least) about my email etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-30/inbox.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple inboxes to keep track of emails that need to be kept around.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I want to keep &lt;strong&gt;track of emails that require future attention&lt;/strong&gt;. For this, I use Gmail’s star feature and the Multiple Inboxes lab plugin. Messages can get tagged with one of three star colors: red for emails that require a reply or attention (i.e. a to-do item), green for receipts that I need to submit for reimbursement, and purple for emails I’ll need at some point in the future (e.g. race sign-up information, flight confirmations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I can &lt;strong&gt;easily follow up on all three groups since they’re right there next to my inbox&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to Multiple Inboxes. I try to keep the to-do list (red) as short as possible. I can quickly figure out what I need to submit for reimbursement by looking at the list of emails tagged with a green star. And when my parents ask me what time my flight gets in, there is no need for me to search my inbox; I can just look at the messages tagged with a purple star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I’m not a celebrity or some company executive, but if I was, I believe this strategy could scale to a point where I wouldn’t need to hire someone to manage my email, calendar, or visits to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Indiegogo's Design Update</title>
   <link href="/2014/04/24/on-indiegogos-design-update/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/04/24/on-indiegogos-design-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Indiegogo recently updated the design of their webpage. As with any change, people have opinions and I’ve got some myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/indie.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The old (left) and new (right) design of the contribute panel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I am not a designer, and do not purport myself to be one. But I do have feelings about this design that may or may not be grounded in sound design principles. To be safe, just consider me a guy with an opinion (dangerous) and enough time to put said opinions on the Internet (extremely dangerous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/like-1.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible funding and funding duration separated in the new design.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like&lt;/strong&gt; - In the new design, they hid the explanation of what Flexible Funding is behind a question mark. In the old design, the explanation for flexible funding was awkward, because it was an explanation of what flexible funding is, followed by the funding duration which is independent of flexible funding. The new design floats the funding duration explanation up and separates the two (i.e. what the funding duration is and what flexible funding is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/dislike-1.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thin and blending into the background is in style.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dislike&lt;/strong&gt; - The text color. Holy crap this is so annoying because it makes no sense to me and everyone seems to be doing it these days. Why are people making fonts thinner and more similar in color to the background!? Who thought having a thin, light grey font on a white background is a good idea? Do you want to make it hard for me to read the text? BECAUSE IT DOES. If it’s information that’s less important and you don’t want to call attention to it, just get rid of it. Don’t freaking camouflage it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/like-2.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new design brings all the text together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like&lt;/strong&gt; - In the old design, the elements explaining how far along something was funded was: text amount of money raised, bar indicating percentage raised, and text of the total amount desired. It seems a bit disjointed because you would read it as “x dollars raised,” then here’s a pretty picture that indicates some percentage towards completion, followed by “out of y dollars.” The new design floats all the text up, and puts the graph at the bottom. From top to bottom it now reads as “x dollars raised out of y,” (red box) followed by a picture to show you this information (blue box).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/indifferent-1.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These days, all the COOL buttons are FLAT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indifferent&lt;/strong&gt; - The new, FLATTER contribute button. Flat design is all the rage these days, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say it: “I don’t see what the big freaking deal about flat everything is.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there we have it. Frightened readers (or lovers of flat buttons and hard-to-read text) should be comforted by the fact that I’m only a software developer and not a designer!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Recovering from Heartbleed</title>
   <link href="/2014/04/22/recovering-from-heartbleed/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/04/22/recovering-from-heartbleed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-22/heartbleed.png&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;It turns out the backbone of secure communication across the Internet has had a catastrophic bug &amp;mdash; Heartbleed &amp;mdash; in it for the past two years. Yikes! One of the most frightening things about Heartbleed is no one really knows if the bug was ever exploited. Were some evil Communist people doing nefarious, Un-American things? Was a popular US information agency snooping on you to keep you safe? No one knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	
	As always, it's best to err on the side of caution. If you've been getting emails from banks and online services recommending you change your passwords, it's because Heartbleed. That said, I think most people didn't even need Heartbleed to be in a compromised situation because quite frankly, most people suck at managing their security. Let's talk passwords!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I think a lot of people’s password situation is like: &lt;strong&gt;one password that is used everywhere.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t blame people for not having a unique password for every service because who could remember all those? Even with mnemonics, it’s hard to remember a ton of passwords. You can try to get cute with your passwords, but if myAwesomeLinkedInPassword is your LinkedIn password, I have a pretty good idea what your Amazon password is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you don’t need Heartbleed to compromise your security on the Internet; all you need is &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; service to get hacked. From there, hackers will have a field day if you used that password elsewhere. Some people have different levels of password: one password they use for sites they don’t care about and a different password used only for important services. But this is still unsafe: one compromised “important service” and all your important services are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I getting at here? &lt;strong&gt;Use a password manager.&lt;/strong&gt; A password manager lets you easily have unique passwords for every service you use, and it lets you make passwords as complex as possible. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/rshay/pubs/passwords_and_people2011.pdf&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; shows that the length of a password is more important than the composition (e.g. one symbol, one number, one upper-case letter). So make your passwords as long as possible, and make them unique. With a password manager, you won’t need to know what your password is; just let the manager fill in all the info for you. I use and like 1Password (a somewhat questionable name for a product that encourages having many different passwords), but you can take your pick at the many that are out there. &lt;strong&gt;Make your passwords hard to crack (long passwords) and make sure a compromised service doesn’t compromise any other services (unique passwords)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-22/1password.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use 1Password to manage hundreds of passwords!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I recover from Heartbleed? My 1Password database has over 700 logins in it! I wasn’t going to update all of them, so I went through the entire list and made a folder of Important items. That list ended up containing a much more manageable 70 items. From there, &lt;strong&gt;it took me an hour to update all of my important logins&lt;/strong&gt;. Boom! Done. I never knew the original passwords, and I don’t know the new ones either. But I can tell you they are all unique and as long as possible. If there is ever another Heartbleed-level security compromise, I’ll go through my Important folder and update the passwords once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one service ever gets compromised, or in the case of Heartbleed — over half the internet — you shouldn’t have a sinking feeling in your stomach. No worries about your Facebook friends that are about to get spammed and no worries about your bank account that may be having its funds drained. Be prepared — start using a password manager. This isn’t fear-mongering. You don’t have to look too far into the past to find large companies like LinkedIn and Adobe leaking millions of users’ credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we’re here, I’d be remiss not to discuss that &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/936/&quot;&gt;xkcd on password strength&lt;/a&gt;. “correct horse battery staple” is a better password than “Tr0ub4dor&amp;amp;3,” but you know what’s ridiculously (like trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions) better than both of these? This wonderful abomination: “68qeu3Raj72e3db6upNFekivUf8688T”. Here’s how long the &lt;a href=&quot;https://passfault.appspot.com/password_strength.html&quot;&gt;Passfault Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; says it would take to crack each of these passwords:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tr0ub4dor&amp;amp;3 - &lt;strong&gt;less than 1 day!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;correct horse battery staple - &lt;strong&gt;1 year, 11 months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8qeu3Raj72e3db6upNFekivUf8688T - &lt;strong&gt;935,300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s a ridiculous amount of time. The universe itself is &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; 14,000,000,000 years old. If you think the universe is only 6,000 years old, this is &lt;strong&gt;EVEN MORE&lt;/strong&gt; impressive. And best of all, I don’t need to think about a stupid horse, battery, staples, or how correct one of them might be. I don’t need to think at all; let a computer program do what it does best and remember things for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-22/jack_bauer.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not even this man can get your passwords out of you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also - the most important benefit of not knowing any of your passwords is actually not knowing them. So when Jack Bauer bursts into your house and demands you tell him the password to your Communist Nuclear Control Dashboard, you can tell him you honestly don’t know. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Smackathon 2014 - Magic Piano on the PS Vita</title>

   <id>/2014/04/18/smackathon-2014---magic-piano-on-the-ps-vita</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today wrapped up Smule’s first Smackathon (a Smulean hackathon) of 2014. Armed with clairvoyant vision and a burning desire to be amazing, The Backstreet Trolls (me and Josh Wu) set out to port the popular Magic Piano to the PlayStation Vita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/running.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony provides development tools for building and running applications on a Vita. The language of choice is C#, which provided a nearly seamless transition for someone coming from Android (Java) development. Contrary to its name, C# is actually more like Java than C. Fortunately, Sony also provides a bunch of great examples we were able to mess around with. The IDE – PlayStation Mobile Studio – wasn’t great. It confounded us many times with odd behavior and unhelpful error messages. When you think Eclipse is a better IDE, you know you’ve got some problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/ide.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A weak IDE, but the Simulator wasn't half bad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh took care of everything audio. For the actual piano sounds, we implemented a system similar to the Android version of Magic Piano: we played sounds from a bank of sound files. Josh also handled converting some songs into a format that our application could parse. I took care of the rest: reading in the music files Josh wrote up, placing the notes on the screen, and making them fall gracefully down the screen. Within a day, we had a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/troll-mode.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troll Mode enabled!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 24 hours left, we knew that there was much room for improvement. I took the the road more travelled and made tweaks to gameplay, optimized texture loading and sprite rendering,  and &lt;i&gt;*gasp*&lt;/i&gt; refactored and cleaned up our code to make it more maintainable and extendable. But Josh took the road less traveled. I added a button for enabling “troll mode,” and let Josh run wild. In troll mode, the images representing notes became Smule employees making troll faces, and the piano sounds were all replaced with us singing our approximation of said notes. He took the road less traveled, and it made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/backstreet-trolls.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Backstreet Trolls with Magic Piano for PS Vita!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our project was awesome. All the Smuleans put in great effort and it’s pretty spectacular what we all produced in such a short amount of time. The Backstreet Trolls are eagerly looking forward to the next Smackathon, which will close out what should be an eventful 2014!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Ways to Static in Java</title>
   <link href="/2014/03/20/5-ways-to-static-in-java/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/03/20/5-ways-to-static-in-java</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone asked me the other day if I knew about all the usages of static in Java. Turns out, I didn’t know them all! Let’s review them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Static methods&lt;/strong&gt; - Methods of class can be static or non-static. Non-static methods are called instance methods because they can only be invoked on an instance of the particular class they belong to. Static methods can be called without any instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Static variables&lt;/strong&gt; - Like static methods, static variables do not belong to instances of a class. If you have a static variable, its value is global and shared. Instance variables require an instance of the class; static variables do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Nested static classes&lt;/strong&gt; - Sometimes you have a class that is only useful to one class so you nest it in another class. This nested class can be static or non-static. If the nested class is static, it cannot directly access instance variables of the outer class that contains it. If the nested class is non-static it is called an inner class. Instances of inner classes can only exist within instances of the outer class that contains them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Static initializers&lt;/strong&gt; - Static initializers are blocks of code that are executed (top-down) when the class is loaded. As the name implies, they can be used to initialize things in a static context. For example, if you have a JSON mapper class (as seen below) with a static ObjectMapper, you can configure it when the class is invoked, rather than having to call an initialization method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;JsonUtils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ALLOW_SINGLE_QUOTES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Static imports&lt;/strong&gt; - A static import allows you to refer to fields and members of a class without actually specifying the class. For example, if you wanted to access the value of Pi in the Math class, you would normally do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.lang.Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t want to specify that PI is in the Math class you can do a static import:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is useful in certain cases, but if abused, can make code harder to read since magical constants of mysterious origin may be referenced without too much context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I do?&lt;/strong&gt; I knew the first three, and was prodded into the fourth one since I had used it a few times previously. I had absolutely no idea about static imports. Then again, my amazing development tool of choice, IntelliJ, handles importing any and every file I need.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tale of Two Xiaolongbao</title>
   <link href="/2014/03/04/tale-of-two-xiaolongbao/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/03/04/tale-of-two-xiaolongbao</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My quest to sample the entire frozen foods section of the Chinese super market continues. I picked up two bags of Shanghai Soup Dumplings (xiaolongbao) the other day. On the left is Mini Soupy Buns by Prime Food, and on the right is Pork Mini Buns (Crab Meat Added) by Wei-Chuan. What happens next NEEDS to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-03-04/two_bags.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two dumplings vie for a special place in my heart...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into the steamer they go! So far, they look pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-03-04/frozen.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Food (right) and Wei-Chuan (left)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes later, I have some steamed dumplings waiting for me. The Prime Food dumplings look a biter paler than the Wei-Chuan ones, but if they both taste great, I won’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-03-04/cooked.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Food (right) and Wei-Chuan (left)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they don’t taste the same. The &lt;strong&gt;Prime Food dumplings are TERRIBLE&lt;/strong&gt;. So terrible, I spat out my first bite and dropped the rest into the trash. The meat tasted over-processed and the dumpling skin was… gooey. On the other hand, the &lt;strong&gt;Wei-Chuan dumplings were GREAT&lt;/strong&gt; – so great that I still can’t believe they came from a bag out of my freezer. These bad boys are packed with delicious meat and broth. Who would’ve thought these two would be so different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-03-04/crab.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't believe his lies...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the little crab guy on the Prime Food bag that looks really happy, screw you for being such a DECEIVER. There isn’t ANY happiness in this bag.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Frozen Pork Bun Face-Off</title>
   <link href="/2014/03/02/frozen-pork-bun-face-off/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/03/02/frozen-pork-bun-face-off</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In July of 2013, some friends and I went on a &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/07/04/bbq-pork-bun-crawl---san-francisco/&quot;&gt;BBQ Pork Bun crawl in SF&lt;/a&gt;. It was great because I was able to indulge my addiction to pork buns while at the same time offering reviews of several pork bun establishments – for the public good, of course. Very recently, I have discovered the frozen foods section at a local Chinese grocery store, which stocks a ton of frozen pork buns. I grabbed every package of bun, took them home, and stuffed them in my freezer. Instead of crawling the foggy city, I crawled my freezer in search of the best pork buns in the bunch. Off we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-03-02/contenders.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The contenders enter the arena!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight different types (7 steamed, 1 baked) of pork buns were purchased from Marina Foods in San Mateo. Between all the buns, two companies were represented: Myriad Foods (2 buns) and Prime Foods (6 buns). Each bun was judged on a scale of 1 (bad) to 3 (great) in two different categories: taste of the meat, and taste of the bread. Note that personal preference plays a large role when it comes to judging a pork bun because there is no single ideal way to make a pork bun. For example, some people prefer their meat sweeter, while others enjoy their buns more savory. We both tasted each of the eight buns and talked through our feelings, arriving at the following results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;margin-bottom: 1em; min-width: 700px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Bun&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Meat Quality&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Bread Quality&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;Myriad Cha Siu BBQ Pork Buns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;Myriad Pork and Vegetable Buns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;Prime Food Steamed Pork Bun (Hang Zhou Style)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Prime Food Steam Buns with Roasted Pork Buns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;Prime Food Leek and Pork Bun&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Prime Food Steam Roasted Pork Bun with Oyster Flavor Sauce&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;Prime Food Pork and Cabbage Bun with Oyster Flavor Sauce&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;Prime Food Roasted Pork Bun (Baked)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results can generally fall into three groups: buns we enjoyed (green), buns we won’t be buying again (red), and the buns in between – good, but not great (black). Even though the bread isn’t anything to brag about, the &lt;strong&gt;Prime Food Steam Buns with Roasted Pork Buns&lt;/strong&gt; were my favorites because of the sweet-flavored meat inside. Only one bun got a perfect score: the &lt;strong&gt;Prime Food Steam Roasted Pork Bun with Oyster Flavor Sauce&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though the meat inside is savory, it’s still a good bun. The three buns that got tagged in red contained meat that tasted totally off – I mean, was it even meat?! Don’t want to know. That said, they still might be right up your alley given how different people’s tastes are when it comes to pork buns. The three buns in black just aren’t good enough to take up the valuable real estate in my freezer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-03-02/winners.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our four favorite pork buns!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad (and scared) that I have such easy access to a wonderful selection of pork buns in my freezer. They may not be fresh out of the oven, but there are some pretty great buns to be had without ever having to leave the comfort of your home. It’s true when they say, “Home is where the delicious pork buns are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

   <title>Weekend Video Game Warrior</title>
   <link href="/2014/02/24/weekend-video-game-warrior/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/02/24/weekend-video-game-warrior</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finished playing Bravely Default earlier this week. I’ll write a longer post about it but here’s the tl;dr – it’s an amazing game. Up next on my playlist includes Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, MGS 5, and Final Fantasy X HD – all still unreleased. With a “free” weekend, I took the time to check out various titles I’ve been thinking about playing. Here’s a whirlwind tour of the games I checked out this weekend as a valiant &lt;strong&gt;Weekend Video Game Warrior&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-24/weapon_shop.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapon Shop de Omasse (3DS)&lt;/strong&gt; - A very humorous and lighthearted twist on the JRPG genre. In this game, the Evil Lord is returning and brave adventurers are setting out to take him down. But you’re not going anywhere because you need to run a weapon shop in Starting City. You rent weapons to your patrons, which forces you to care about whether they survive their quests. You’ll spend most of your time forging weapons (rhythm game) and polishing weapons (rubbing the screen until the weapon is shiny). There is plenty of self-deprecating humor, both when you meet NPCs and heroes who visit your shop and via the Twitter-esque live feed called the Grindcast. I’m very glad Level 5 finally got around to releasing the last piece of the Guild01 series in the US because its a fun, quirky, and addictive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-top: 40px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-24/vc3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valkyria Chronicles 3 (PSP)&lt;/strong&gt; - This game was never actually released (and never will be) in the US because Sega sucks. But a bunch of enterprising fans created a fan translation for this game. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my favorite games on the PS3. Valkyria Chronicles 2 (VC2) on the PSP was good too. Like its predecessor, Valkyria Chronicles 3 (VC3) is more of the same, but that’s not a bad thing at all. Chronologically, VC3 takes place during the same time as the original. Instead of being part of the regular army, this time you are part of a penal military squad that is given the most dangerous missions. Like previous entries, battles are grand and some are quite challenging. To everyone at the Valkyria Chronicles 3 Translation Project, thank you for letting English-speakers play this gem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-top: 40px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-24/p4a.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persona 4 Arena (PS3)&lt;/strong&gt; - Persona 5 is scheduled for a 2014 Winter release on the PS3 in Japan. I’m hoping for a worldwide release, but I’m unsure that will happen. After having such a great time playing Persona 4 Golden (Vita), I’m craving more and more Persona. Instead of diving into Persona 3 which could easily become a 100+ hour investment, I decided to revisit Inaba in the form of a fighting game: Persona 4 Arena (P4A). A collaboration between the team behind Persona (Atlus) and the team behind Guilty Gear and BlazBlue (Arc System Works), P4A delivers a story-driven sequel to Persona 4 with arcade-style fights mixed throughout. I don’t like fighting games much, so I’m planning to watch a Let’s Play series of it so I can get the story and skip the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;StarCraft 2 (Mac/PC)&lt;/strong&gt; - StarCraft 2 has become part of my daily routine that I oftentimes forget I’m playing a video game. Dubbed “The One True Game” by Ge Wang, I can never get enough StarCraft. I’m not “intense” enough to play 1v1, so unless I’m playing the campaign, I’m always playing with friends. StarCraft is the game that never gets boring; each game is unique and with three different races, the match-ups, possibilities, and outcomes are endless. If you haven’t played StarCraft yet, the Starter Edition lets you play all Arcade games for free. It’s worth checking out! GG!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (Wii U)&lt;/strong&gt; - Man, I really want to like this game. It’s ridiculously beautiful and the original Donkey Kong Country games on the SNES are some of my all-time favorite games. But, like Donkey Kong Country Returns (Wii, 3DS), I find the controls are too sluggish and complicated. To me, the game is challenging because the controls are hard to grasp, not because the game is inherently challenging. Perhaps the Wii U GamePad is the issue, so I’ll try again with the older-school Pro Controller. Honestly, I think expecting the tight handling from the original SNES games might have been my undoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-top: 40px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-24/swd.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SteamWorld Dig (3DS)&lt;/strong&gt; - Sometimes the craziest ideas make the best games. In SteamWorld Dig, you are a robot that inherits a mine from your uncle. You arrive at the mine and from there you dig, dig, dig, and dig some more. As you carve into the mine, you’ll find puzzles to solve and minerals to sell, which lets you upgrade yourself (the perk of being a robot). The controls are super tight (especially welcome after my disappointing experience with Donkey Kong Country), and the game ropes you into an addictive loop of explore, gather, and upgrade. I think I’ll stop writing here, so I can get back to digging!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Let's Not Talk About How Awesome PS Plus Is</title>

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-16/ps_plus.png&quot; alt=&quot;PS Plus Logo&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I recently read a head-to-head review of the Xbox One and PS4 in the Personal Tech section of the NY Times.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The review pegs the PS4 as the better of the two consoles, but questions if powerful home consoles are even relevant anymore. That flame-war-inspiring question aside, I find the most interesting thing about the review is something that has been repeatedly glossed over by a lot of people (even Sony): how awesome PlayStation Plus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look back at the previous iterations of these juggernauts. The Xbox 360 required an Xbox Live Gold membership if you wanted to play online or use online streaming services (e.g. Netflix). If you were on a PS3, you could enjoy online multiplayer and streaming services for free. The Xbox One inherited the 360’s fee-based access to both multiplayer and streaming services as the reviewer points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;[On the Xbox One, to] access streaming media, apps or even the channel guide, you must pay for a $60-per-year Xbox Live Gold account, on top of your Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime or any other service subscription fee.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many people’s disappointment, the PS4 is not &lt;strong&gt;100% free&lt;/strong&gt; like its predecessor. While you won’t need to pay for access to streaming services on the PS4, you will need to have PlayStation Plus (the equivalent of Xbox Live Gold) if you want to play online multiplayer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;And unlike the Xbox, [on the PS4] access to streaming services is free. You do need a $50-per-year PlayStation Plus account if you want to play online with other gamers.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people say “Sony went the route of Microsoft when it came to online access for the PS4,” but that isn’t quite right. Because there is one AWESOME thing about PS Plus that doesn’t get talked about enough: the &lt;strong&gt;Instant Game Collection&lt;/strong&gt; (IGC). The IGC is a collection of &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; downloadable games for the PS3, PS4, and Vita. Games are added every month, and some are rotated out, but games you claim can be downloaded so long as you remain a PS Plus member. Yes, it sucks that you need to pay to get access to online multiplayer. But would you feel better if you had access to a ton of free games? It makes me feel REAL good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 900px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-16/ps_plus_games.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Instant Game Collection &amp;mdash; February 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t crappy games either – the current IGC includes heavy hitters like Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands 2, Uncharted 3, and Resogun. Even if you don’t have a PS4 (like me), PS Plus seems like a no-brainer. In just its first year, PS Plus gave free access to games valued at over $1,800!&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; PS Plus members get discounts on games too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes – you do need to pay $50 to access online multiplayer, but you’re going to also get access to a ton of awesome games as well. So when I see people talking about PS Plus and just ignoring this treasure trove, a piece of me dies. For frugal gamers or people who are just curious about certain games, PS Plus is a ridiculous value proposition. If you keep your eyes peeled around Black Friday, you can even buy a year’s worth of PS Plus for only $30. Call the cops because I feel like I’m robbing someone blind!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three Things About Ys: Memories of Celceta</title>
   <link href="/2014/02/04/three-things-about-ys-memories-of-celceta/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/02/04/three-things-about-ys-memories-of-celceta</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-04/ys-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ys: Memories of Celceta&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I was a bit hesitant when I bought a Vita. Compared to the 3DS, most other consoles' game libraries are pathetic. Being in the handheld space, and with such a meager library, no one looked worse than the Vita. Yet, my hesitation is slowly being assuaged as the Vita game library gains some really awesome games. &lt;strong&gt;Ys: Memories of Celceta&lt;/strong&gt; is a welcome addition to the Vita lineup, especially for fans of action RPGs. I plowed through this game and enjoyed it very much. I actually played it so much in one session that my Vita ran out of battery! Exploring the large forest of Celceta, duking it out with baddies, powering up my equipment, and of course &amp;mdash; saving the world &amp;mdash; was a total blast. Instead of waxing poetic about how great this game is, I'd like to discuss three things that stuck out to me while playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;strong&gt;saving your game was weird&lt;/strong&gt;! Ys can be played exclusively with the physical controls (i.e. buttons, joysticks). Navigating menus and certain actions could be completed using the touch screen, but I found myself always sticking to the physical controls. However, there was one place where touch controls were the only way to proceed: saving your game. So in essence, you’re playing a game that can be played exclusively using physical controls, but when you go to save your game, the controls no longer do anything! Obviously a minor user experience hiccup, but a hiccup nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a positive note, Ys &lt;strong&gt;addressed the issue of excessive back-tracking&lt;/strong&gt;. In Ys, you are tasked with exploring the large, mysterious forest of Celceta. Fortunately, there is a system of fast-travel. As you explore the world, you discover monuments of different colors. When you touch a monument, you can fast travel to other monuments of the same color. For example, the starting town has orange monuments, the outside area has yellow monuments, and the forest has light blue monuments. But because you are restricted to fast-travel within one color, you still need to slow-travel between monuments of different colors. It’s usually fine, but the more colors you get, the more tedious it becomes. I was hoping that at some point, all monuments would lose their color attribute, but &lt;strong&gt;Ys one-upped me&lt;/strong&gt;. Halfway through the game, you get a special item called the Golden Wing. The Golden Wing lets you warp to any monument from absolutely anywhere (no need to touch a monument to warp). Just when using the existing fast-travel system was beginning to feel tedious, the system becames even faster and more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there was &lt;strong&gt;the forging system that could’ve used some quality-of-life improvements&lt;/strong&gt;. In Ys, you can reinforce your weapons and armor with materials to give them bonus attributes. For example, your weapon could potentially inflict poison, or your armor could develop resistance to paralysis. It’s possible to efficiently max out all these attributes by following a recipe. The recipe looks something like this: take a weapon and reinforce it with 8 Sturdy Shells, 8 Strong Hairs, 4 Titanic Bones, and 2 Amethyst. Sweet! That’s 5 reinforce operations, right? Nope! The game &lt;strong&gt;does not allow you to fuse multiple items at a time&lt;/strong&gt;. For the aforementioned recipe, you are not performing 5 operations, but 22! If the game allowed multiple items to be reinforced at once, you could create the ultimate weapon with 15 operations. Instead, you’ll actually be performing 56… And you’ll need to keep track of how many of each item you’ve reinforced already, which I screwed up a few times!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-04/ys-forest.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't get the wrong idea - this game is awesome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though two of my three observations are somewhat negative, don’t let my post mislead you: &lt;strong&gt;this game is really great&lt;/strong&gt; and I highly recommend it. If the Vita continues to get games where my only complaints are about user experience inconsistencies and quality-of-life improvements, I see a bright future ahead`` for the Vita.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lightning Returns - Demo Review</title>
   <link href="/2014/02/02/lightning-returns-demo-review/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/02/02/lightning-returns-demo-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll come right out and say it – I’m &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; one of those people who looked at Final Fantasy XIII and saw the series coming to a cataclysmic end. Yes, the linearity of the game sucked. Yes, the story was all over the place – to say the least. But the paradigm shift battle system was awesome and very progressive step forward for JRPG battling. And Final Fantasy XIII-2 was actually pretty good – addressing a lot of the issues of its troubled predecessor. The story, featuring everyone’s favorite plot device – time travel – was decent, yet suffered from that JRPG trope of being “complicated to be complicated.” The ending of XIII-2 was an extremely bold one where the villain, Caius, succeeds and the protagonist, Serah, dies. Square Enix wouldn’t just let the bad guy win, hence the sequel to the sequel – &lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy XIII: Lightning Returns&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-02-02/xiii-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief on the internets, a sequel to a Final Fantasy game does not automatically make it worthless. Given how good the Bravely Default demo was and how I’m not a member of the “FF13 sucks” hive-mind, I decided to give the demo for the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII: Lightning Returns a go. Let’s see how it went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demo opens with video featuring a staff roll. Yet, something’s &lt;strong&gt;already&lt;/strong&gt; off. This doesn’t look like your typical Final Fantasy highlight reel. It looks like an actual scene from the game because characters are talking to each other, but you don’t know what they’re saying because there is no vocal track and there are no subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I click “Playable Demo” - Let’s do it! Oh wait! I’m being bombarded with a ton of pop-ups about “Otherworld” features. Otherworld lets players share screenshots and sell items to other players. I don’t really care about these features, especially for a demo, so I quickly agree to all the end-user agreements that subsequently pop up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving on, things take a turn for the worst. I have to watch the &lt;strong&gt;SAME&lt;/strong&gt; video I just watched, except this time, instead of a staff roll, I get to hear what the characters were saying to each other. I know I’m playing a JRPG, but seriously, what a huge waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demo then introduces the battle system. Lightning battles alone in this game, but can switch between different outfits to change up her abilities. You can switch between 3 outfits in battle. Each outfit has its own ATB gauge that depletes when abilities are used. The ATB gauge for outfits not being used recharges while they are not equipped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some tutorial battles, you get to run around and chase a person-of-interest. Nothing new and wonderful here, but you get to jump over obstacles, climb up ladders, and slide down poles. When I first saw this game, I thought they were trying to make an Assassin’s Creed clone. I’m glad that theory was way off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some exploring, you face off against a boss. My fear with the one-woman-army battle system was confirmed in this battle: the &lt;strong&gt;entire battle was such a drag&lt;/strong&gt;. A helpful pop-up tells us we should stagger the boss to greatly increase damage by targeting its weakness, Thunder, using the Black Mage outfit. So I spammed Thunder until the Black Mage’s ATB gauge was drained, then switched into the other two outfits and just did plain old attacks until the Black Mage’s ATB gauge recharged. The battle took way too long. In the previous two Final Fantasy XIII games, I would just switch my party into a paradigm that could nuke the boss’ weakness to quickly make short work of it. Even when I was targeting the boss’ weakness, it still felt like I was chipping away fruitlessly. Longer battles doesn’t necessarily mean I’m being challenged; this was just tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the boss fight, a pop-up tells us we have until 6:00 AM to play the demo. In Lightning Returns, the world is ending in 13 days. Each in-game day lasts about 2-3 hours in “real-life time.” It’s 3:22 AM so I have about a half hour left to play. I continue through the area and then reach a door where the demo ends &lt;strong&gt;without any warning&lt;/strong&gt;! That’s it. No confirmation that I really am done. No pop-up asking me if I want to end the demo prematurely. Nothing. A cutscene and then I’m thrown back to the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it together Square Enix, because this demo was beyond disappointing. Lightning Returns might actually be a decent game, but this demo did a terrible job showing off the game in the best possible light. For some weird reason, Square Enix decided to release Bravely Default on February 7th and Lightning Returns on February 11th. I’ll be picking up Bravely Default on release day, especially given my terrible experience with the Lightning Returns demo. While I’ll likely eventually check out Lightning Returns, I am in no rush to pick up the game.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Chrono Trigger Symphony is Complete</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/30/the-chrono-trigger-symphony-is-complete/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/30/the-chrono-trigger-symphony-is-complete</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blake Robinson is &lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt; hero video game nerds dream about. This man is literally a one-man army with a virtual orchestra at his fingertips, and he’s put that power to great use. Chrono Trigger is on many people’s list of all-time favorite video games, and the memorable soundtrack (composed by Yasunori Mitsuda) is a pillar of the game’s greatness. Even today, the MIDI-based soundtrack inspires nostalgia and brings even the most powerful nerds to tears. But Blake Robinson would not let Mitsuda’s work be shackled by the 16 channels of MIDI, so he took the original soundtrack, scored it for an orchestra, and let his virtual orchestra play it. Yesterday, he released the third (and final) part of The Chrono Trigger Symphony. Hit the play button below to listen to Yearnings of the Wind and keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUclDZHax0w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a re-imagining or remix of the original soundtrack. The original soundtrack was on three CDs, and The Chrono Trigger Symphony spans three volumes, EXACTLY matching the track-list of the original. I’m no music buff, but Robinson and his virtual orchestra, from start to finish, do a pretty amazing job “musically upscaling” the original soundtrack. Your favorite gems will move you even more, and tracks that previously might’ve not been in your favorites are now competing for those top spots. Never before has being torn felt so freaking good. If you love Chrono Trigger, I can guarantee listening to The Chrono Trigger Symphony will fill you with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade&quot;&gt;saudades&lt;/a&gt; and make you want to dust off your SNES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chrono Trigger Symphony is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thechronosymphony.com/&quot;&gt;available on both Loudr and iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks, Blake Robinson. I am eagerly awaiting your next masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Back It Up</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/24/back-it-up/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/24/back-it-up</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;World Backup Day is two months away, but important messages can’t wait: &lt;strong&gt;back it up right now.&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine this: your computer disappears. How screwed are you? Now imagine this: in addition to your computer disappearing, every hard drive in your home also disappears. Are you ready for DATA DOOMSDAY? The migration to digital has become ubiquitous: everything is going digital. It’s easy to take for granted that a malfunctioning disk can take away with it irreplaceable photos, videos, and documents. Theft sucks. And hard drive recovery services might as well be theft because they cost so much. Plus, your chances of recovering anything are slim to none. THAT being said, it’s not hard to play it safe with your digital data: &lt;strong&gt;just back it up RIGHT NOW.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My backup solution consists of &lt;strong&gt;local backups&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;offsite backups&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cloud backups&lt;/strong&gt;. Yours should too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-24/sp.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A solid investment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local backups&lt;/strong&gt; refer to backups to a drive I have at home. On my Mac, I just plug in a drive and Time Machine handles backing up my entire system. If my computer ever exploded, I could plug the drive into another computer and restore EVERYTHING onto that new machine within an hour. This is especially useful because I don’t want to set up my apps and development environment all over again. Local backups are fast, but somewhat annoying - they require me to plug in a drive and wait while the backup completes. That said, I try to update my local backup every weekend; I configured Google Calendar to remind me every Sunday to back up. If I go 10 days without doing a Time Machine backup, my computer even starts nagging me. Hard drives are cheap (definitely cheaper than hard drive recovery services); I’m a big fan of Silicon Power’s 1 TB shock-proof portable hard drive which costs $70.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back it up, now!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m visiting my family in New Jersey, I do an &lt;strong&gt;offsite backup&lt;/strong&gt; to a drive I have there. If something were to happen to both my computer and my local backup in California, I would &lt;em&gt;only lose a few months of my digital life&lt;/em&gt;. That doesn’t sound particularly good, but it’d be a lot worse to lose everything! When my sister visits California, she backs up to one of my local backup drives. Anyone and everyone you care about – Help them stay backed up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-24/backup-america.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back ups from sea to shining sea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local backups and offsite backups are great, but since you’re unlikely to do them every 5 minutes, drift can occur. That’s where &lt;strong&gt;cloud backups&lt;/strong&gt; come in. Backing up to the cloud is slow, but is a great complement to local and offsite backups.  Your first backup to the cloud will likely take weeks, but subsequent (incremental) backups will be quick. The best thing about cloud backups is that they are automatic and frequent. They should still be considered a last line of defense because restoring from the cloud is painfully slow. That said, I’d rather wait months to get all my data back then have it be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-24/crashplan-logo.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spoiler alert - CrashPlan is the best cloud backup service.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of cloud backup services out there. I’ve tried a bunch of them, but my favorite is &lt;em&gt;CrashPlan&lt;/em&gt;. For &lt;em&gt;under nine bucks a month&lt;/em&gt;, I can back up &lt;em&gt;unlimited data from 10 computers&lt;/em&gt;. If you’ve got a home server, you can even use that as “the cloud” and pay nothing to use CrashPlan. If family or friends have reservations about backing up their data to “the cloud” or your server, they can take comfort in the 448-bit key that encrypts their data. Only with that key can their data be accessed, so make sure they keep it in a safe place! If you need to restore from the cloud quickly, you can even pay CrashPlan a handsome amount ($164.99) to have them ship your backup to you on a hard drive. Honestly, I can’t recommend them enough. I’m slowly getting my entire family and friends set to back up to my home server. Again, good friends keep their friends backed up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know – so run, don’t walk! &lt;strong&gt;Go back it up right now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cooking With My Grandma - Rabanadas</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/18/cooking-with-my-grandma-rabanadas/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/18/cooking-with-my-grandma-rabanadas</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your grandma is usually the best cook you know. My grandma, at least, is definitely the best cook I know. Funnily enough, if we’re friends, my grandma is also likely to be &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; favorite cook. This past holiday season, I shadowed my grandma while she prepared a traditional Portuguese holiday dessert: rabanadas. I always tell my non-Portuguese friends that it’s similar to French Toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/final.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rabanadas a.k.a. Portuguese French Toast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandma doesn’t use recipes – or even measuring utensils. Somehow, the result is always consistently great. Shadowing her, I wasn’t looking to extract an exact recipe out of her, but just to get the basic steps and to get useful tips. Here’s my go at trying to capture some of her cooking magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put what’s coming up in context, the general steps to making rabanadas is: cutting bread, soaking it in milk, soaking it in eggs, and finally frying the bread. I observed my grandma whip up four dozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-youll-need&quot;&gt;What you’ll need&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ingredients are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long Italian loaves – You’ll want to buy the loaves two to three days before you cook so that the loaves harden up a bit. If you use fresh loaves, the bread will begin to fall apart as you cook the rabanadas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Milk – My grandma recommends 2% reduced fat milk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two whole cinnamon sticks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Six spoonfuls of sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some honey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One lemon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nine eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vegetable oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other useful things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting board and knife to cut the bread&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large pan to prepare the milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium-sized pan for the eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strainer and another pan that fits the strainer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frying pan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aluminum tray with cardboard paper lining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Prepare the milk.&lt;/strong&gt; In your large, stove-friendly pot add a generous amount (about one liter) of milk. Take a lemon and skin it; add the skin to the milk. Be careful - don’t add any lemon flesh! The rind and white spongey layer is okay. Then add two whole cinnamon sticks, about 6 spoonfuls of sugar, and some honey (optional). Then warm this up on the stove a bit to help everything dissolve and blend together. If you run out of milk later, you can just add more milk (and sugar) to replenish your supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/milk.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Whisk the eggs.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll want about 3 eggs for every dozen rabanadas. Put them in a pan and whisk them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/eggs.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Set up the strainer.&lt;/strong&gt; Later, you will be dipping the bread in the eggs. When you do that, you’ll want to let some of the excess milk and egg fall off before putting the bread in hot oil. Thus, why you need a strainer. Put your strainer in a pot, and you can recycle the liquid that falls out and put it back in the whisked eggs pan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/strainer.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Add oil to the frying pan.&lt;/strong&gt; My grandma puts about 1 cm of oil in a frying pan. At first, the stove was set to 7/10 but as the oil got hotter, she brought it down to 5/10. After each dozen rabanadas you make, my grandma recommends changing the oil. As you cook the bread, small pieces will fall off, and in the hot oil, those pieces will burn up. You don’t want pieces of burnt bread on the finished product!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/oil.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fresh oil (left) and oil after frying some bread (right).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Prepare your “landing zone.”&lt;/strong&gt; A proper “landing zone” has something that will soak up the oil, but not fall apart. My grandma uses an aluminum tray with the paper from the paper bag the loaves come in. This is likely the only recorded instance of my grandma “recycling.” Don’t use paper towels because my grandma said so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/landing.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Cut the bread.&lt;/strong&gt; My grandma just says “cut the bread,” but she actually made every piece of bread consistently 1.5 inches wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/cutting.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;steps-to-rabanadas&quot;&gt;4 steps to rabanadas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done all the prep work, set up everything like the picture below. You’ll work your way from left to right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/5_steps.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start on the left and work over to the right.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Into the milk.&lt;/strong&gt; First, put your slices of bread into the pan of milk. You don’t want to let the bread soak for too long in the milk because it will begin to fall apart, but you do want milk to get thoroughly absorbed into the bread. For reference, my grandma would let the bread soak in the milk between 90 and 120 seconds. Make sure you get all sides of the bread soaked; if you have only a little bit of milk or the bread is floating be sure every side gets some time in the milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/in_milk.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;And then into the eggs.&lt;/strong&gt; Moving on, you’ll put the bread into the pan with the whisked eggs. This part shouldn’t take too long; my grandma didn’t leave the bread in there for longer than half a minute, ever. Just get some egg on there, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Drain excess liquid.&lt;/strong&gt; Before putting the bread into the frying pan my grandma puts the bread in a strainer for a minute or so. This lets any excess liquid drain, which cuts down on the pain you’ll experience if hot liquid starts popping out from the frying pan! If you’re running low on eggs, just use the liquid that drains out in this step to refill your egg pan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/in_strainer.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Fry the bread.&lt;/strong&gt; The general steps are 1) fry one side until golden, 2) flip the bread, and 3) fry the other side until golden, before taking it out. Grandma says you should avoid flipping it more than one time because you will absorb more oil, so feel free to lift the bread up a little bit to double-check before you flip it over. It takes about 2 to 3 minutes of frying on each side to hit the sweet spot, although the time will vary depending on how hot your oil is. Once both sides are golden, carefully remove the bread (grandma uses a barbecue fork) and place them in your “landing zone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/in_pan.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bread just placed in the pan (left) and bread fried the proper amount (right).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinse and repeat until you’re out of bread and you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-were-done&quot;&gt;And we’re done!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t seem so hard, but I know the minute I try to do it myself, I’ll totally screw it up. That said, rabanadas seem like a good first excursion into attempting to cook Portuguese dishes! Bom apetite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-18/grandma.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cook and the rabanadas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Surviving Death - Android Activities</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/14/surviving-death-android-activities/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/14/surviving-death-android-activities</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s a fact of life: your Android activities aren’t always going to be the center of attention. They can be backgrounded either because your entire app is backgrounded or because another activity of your app is pushed onto the activity stack. Even sadder, while backgrounded, your activity (and its state) can be entirely destroyed. If you don’t handle this case, the eventual return of your activity will be less-than-ideal. Fortunately, it’s not that hard to handle this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Use Android Annotations.&lt;/strong&gt; Besides being used in the forthcoming examples, Android Annotations helps you write simpler code. Everyone loves simpler code. &lt;a href=&quot;http://androidannotations.org/&quot;&gt;Get it now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Develop and test with “Don’t keep activities” option turned on.&lt;/strong&gt; Under normal circumstances, activities can be destroyed when you background them in low-memory situations. Enabling this option (in Settings ~&amp;gt; Developer Options) will force a pathological low-memory environment and activities will be destroyed as soon as you leave them. Don’t be lazy. Turn on this option, and make sure your activities can handle getting sent to the grave and getting revived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Use static methods to generate intents for your activities.&lt;/strong&gt; Using helper methods to generate ready-to-go intents forces you to pass data you’ll need for your activity to function properly. The data you pass in to these methods is data you will likely be concerned about when activities start getting destroyed and recreated. This is also useful if you need to later pass additional data to your activity. Add any new parameters, hit compile, and fix all the errors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this static method generates an intent for starting the ResilientActivity class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;generateResilientActivityIntent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// _ after the class name because it's using Android Annotations&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ResilientActivity_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;putExtra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ACCOUNT_ID_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Figure out what to save when an activity is destroyed and @InstanceState it.&lt;/strong&gt; Both of these are easy. First, any of the parameters you pass to your intent-generating methods you likely want to save. You’d used them to create the activity, so you’ll want them again when you recreate the activity. For these values, create fields and annotate them with @InstanceState. If your activity is destroyed, the code generated by Android Annotations will automagically save these fields to the bundle. If you’ve got complex objects, this will work if they implement the Parcelable interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// fields annotated with @InstanceState cannot be private&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@InstanceState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mAccountId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;In onCreate, @InstanceState will be handled for you so just check for a null savedInstanceState and parse the data out yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve set everything else up, the only thing left to do is figure out what state you’re in in your onCreate method. If the activity is getting created for the first time, the Bundle passed in will be null and you’ll want to parse out all that data you stashed into your Intent. Otherwise, you’re getting recreated and the onCreate super method will handle restoring all annotated fields (courtesy of Android Annotations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;onCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bundle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;savedInstanceState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// if we are getting recreated, savedInstanceState will not be null&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// the call to super.onCreate will handle restoring any fields annotated with @InstanceState&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;savedInstanceState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// if savedInstanceState is null, we are getting created for the first time,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// so parse out the data from the intent&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;savedInstanceState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mAccountId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getIntent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getStringExtra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ACCOUNT_ID_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;	
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s it!&lt;/strong&gt; You can test the resilience of your activities by backgrounding your application or going to another activity and then returning back to that activity. In the hands of your customers, expect your app to be backgrounded for long periods of time and running on devices where a plethora of other apps are running. Eventually, an activity is going to pay the price and get sent to the grave to free up resources. Will your app’s return to life be elegant and seamless, or a disaster?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>OMFG Persona 4</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/12/omfg-persona-4/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/12/omfg-persona-4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget the first video game I ever played: Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES). And I’ll never forget the first time I fell in love with a game: Super Mario RPG and the Legend of the Seven Stars (SNES). Times have changed and so have I, and the &lt;em&gt;magic&lt;/em&gt; of video games seems to have waned. So in order not to feel disappointed most of the time, I tell myself, “You’re not a kid anymore. It’s not going to be as magical anymore.” Yet, there are rare moments when I feel like a kid all over again. It’s moments like these that I realize I’m playing a game that is going to join the Pantheon of Greats, which features amazing (mostly JRPG) games like Xenoblade, Chrono Trigger, Terranigma, Final Fantasy VI, Valkyrie Profile, and Grandia II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-12/p4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The newest member of the Pantheon of Greats: Persona 4 Golden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, this happened with Persona 4 Golden (P4G) for the Playstation Vita. It was truly a game that excited me from start to finish. An enhanced re-release of the PS2 original, P4G knocked my socks off. I don’t need to write a long rave review about this game; there are already plenty of them out there. In short, this game is novel, quirky (in the best way), wonderfully designed, and was &lt;em&gt;an absolute pleasure to play and experience&lt;/em&gt;. Even though exposure to lots of video games as well as adulthood has made me feel jaded at times, I am happy to report that there is still magic out there…. So the hunt continues!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bravely Default Demo Review</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/10/bravely-default-demo-review/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/10/bravely-default-demo-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bravely Default Flying Fairy&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I did something strange this past week. I played a demo for a game &amp;mdash; something I don't usually do. And I played it for a whopping seven hours. The 3DS is on a quest to hog up all my gaming time and with high caliber games &amp;mdash; like Bravely Default &amp;mdash; on the horizon, it's doing a great job. I was impressed with the demo for Bravely Default from start to finish. Here are some of my thoughts on the game so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bravely Default’s &lt;strong&gt;demo&lt;/strong&gt; is also just cool in and of itself. Many demos are just a random slice of the full game. But Bravely Default’s demo actually features quests that don’t exist in the full game. In addition, there are item set perks you can earn for completing these demo quests, which transfer over to the full game. None of these are game-breaking bonuses either, so you’re not ruining the challenge of the game. They’ll just help out your gold wallet early on when gold is tight!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/battle.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Default&quot; in battle to build up turns for later.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;battle system&lt;/strong&gt; is straight old-school with a minor twist based on the game’s odd title. In battle, you can choose to Default which is the equivalent of defending. Using Default also grants you an extra Battle Point (BP). On the other hand, you can spend BP via the Brave command to input multiple commands (e.g. Attack, cast a spell, and then heal your party) all in one turn. Your party starts with 0 BP each battle and you can go negative with your BP. If you’re sure you can wipe the enemy out in one turn, you can Brave all your characters to -4 BP and wail away at the enemy. If the enemy doesn’t die, you’re in trouble because until you have 0 BP, you cannot act again. You are effectively in BP debt. Each turn restores 1 BP – so you better hope the enemies don’t wipe you out while you sit there helplessly for 4 turns! Are you going to play it safe or go balls to the wall and try to destroy your enemy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/jobs.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 of the 26 available jobs: Pirate, Spell Fencer, Valkyrie, Vampire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;job system&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty dang cool. It reminded me a lot of Final Fantasy V. After each battle, your characters earn experience which levels up the character and their base stats. But you also earn job points which level up the job your characters currently have selected. The game features standard jobs like Black Mage, Knight, Ninja, but also more quirky jobs like Pirate, Vampire, Valkyrie, and Spell Fencer. As you level jobs up you gain access to active combat abilities and passive skills. When you switch jobs, you can mix and match these active and passive skills, so leveling up different jobs is encouraged. For example, while playing the demo, I found the Knight’s “Two-Hand” ability, which means the character sacrifices holding a shield and instead holds their weapon with two hands to raise their attack power. It was really freaking powerful. I leveled up everyone in the Knight class so they could unlock this skill, and in the end, everyone was two-handing their weapons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/norende.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We've got a town to rebuild!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is also some &lt;strong&gt;“town-building”&lt;/strong&gt; in this game. A village is destroyed early on in the game and you are tasked with helping rebuild it. Residents of the town can be assigned to the reconstruction effort. The more residents you have, the faster the reconstruction happens. For example, to build the Item Shop, it would take 2 hours for one resident, 1 hour for two residents, and 30 minutes for three residents. As you build and expand shops, you get access to powerful items. You pick up a few residents automatically during the game, but every Streetpass tag you get adds another resident. Finally, my Spillpass-Pi (a Raspberry Pi that fetches you an inordinate amount of Streetpass tags) will see some more action! Another perk of playing the demo: you can transfer 20 residents over to the full game to get a nice boost in your future labor force!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/pretty.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The overworld (left) and the clock-inspired town of Ancheim (right).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even though the 3DS isn’t a &lt;strong&gt;graphics&lt;/strong&gt; powerhouse, Bravely Default is pretty gorgeous considering. The overworld (that’s right - an old-school overworld) is vivid, lush, and covered in varied geographies. It feels like what Chrono Trigger would be if it was redone in 3D. Not only is the overworld good-looking, so are the towns. The town of Ancheim – featured in the demo – is designed like a clock with tons of winding gears and an antique feel. If you just stop and take it all in for a moment, the game even helps out by zooming out – allowing you to take in more of the scene. The &lt;strong&gt;music&lt;/strong&gt; was composed by the Japanese musical group Revo, who also composed the awesome opening themes for Attack on Titan. In JRPGs, you’ll be listening to the battle theme a lot, so I’m happy to say this battle theme is definitely something I can listen to over and over again. Check out the theme below!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/grZA2ZrAdTU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even though this game is an homage to the olden days of Final Fantasy, it does include some &lt;strong&gt;quality-of-life improvements&lt;/strong&gt; that address some typical JRPG complaints. Battle speed (the speed of the animations in battle) can be easily be toggled from super fast to a total pause. For trash mobs in dungeons, I always kept things at maximum speed because I had a good idea of how difficult the battle would be ahead of time. For bosses, I would slow things down to check out elemental affinities and other important battle-related metrics. The game also lets you change difficulty on-the-fly. If normal isn’t challenging enough, jump up to hard. If you realize you bit off more than you can chew, jump back down to normal (or even easy). No more restarting your entire game. And more than that can be toggled: battle encounter rate can be turned down to 0 or doubled, destination markers indicating where to go next can be disabled, and you can even turn off EXP/gold/job point gains after battles. If you’re into custom challenges, like low-level challenges, this game makes it surprisingly easy to fulfill your masochist tendencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 7th can’t come fast enough.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll be spending my weekend digging into what looks to be another awesome JRPG addition to the 3DS.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mark.gg/2013/12/29/portuglish-words/&quot;&gt;bastard words created by mixing English and Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;. I only thought of a few, but after putting my shortlist out there, a ton of people came out of the woodwork with tons of good ones that I missed. Thanks, friends!

   <title>May Jesus Be With Your Signage</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/06/may-jesus-be-with-your-signage/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/06/may-jesus-be-with-your-signage</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I dropped by the Portuguese Consulate in Newark, NJ to take care of some top secret diplomatic business. An engineer by trade, I secretly harbor an anal-retentive designer in the depths of my heart. While waiting to take care of some important business, I peered over at the welcome signage and cried out in pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-06/typography.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hallelujah! Jesus-Christ-certified Identity Cards!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ! They spelled &lt;strong&gt;bilhetes&lt;/strong&gt; with a Latin Cross (&lt;strong&gt;✝&lt;/strong&gt;)! This was also the only occurrence of this most holy swap on the entire signage. I didn’t have the gall to ask the front desk what was up with the Jesus-infused character set. Was it a zealous designer subtly informing us that Catholicism is the dominant religion in Portugal? Maybe. I’d like to believe it was divine interven✝ion…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2013 - The Year in Food</title>
   <link href="/2014/01/01/2013-the-year-in-food/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/01/01/2013-the-year-in-food</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;style media=&quot;screen&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;

div.space {
	height: 18px;
}

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be the kind of person that would find two or three decent restaurants and just visit them over and over again. In June, after another amazing meal at Panda Dumpling in San Carlos (read: not at all related to the chain Panda Express), I proudly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/panda-dumpling-san-carlos#hrid:2JurJhZx-_Veom6ghp0VXA&quot;&gt;penned&lt;/a&gt; my first Yelp review. I’ve got a big appetite and a big mouth – After that first review, I realized I couldn’t just keep my opinions to myself. I also realized I was going to have to take some risks and explore what the wider food world had to offer if I expected to find more gems like Panda Dumpling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, it’s been a veritable firestorm of trying new places and writing more reviews. Here is an overview of my 2013 food findings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-01/5stars.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;From top left to bottom right: Shrimp and Eggs Chow Fun and Beef Lo Mein (Cafe Salina), Strawberry Peach Cobbler (Passionfish), Lion King (Cha Cha Sushi), Portuguese Roll and Pasteis de Nata (Teixeira's Bakery)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.25em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Star Restaurants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;In 2013, I penned a whopping 208 Yelp reviews. I was pretty stingy when it came to giving out 5 star reviews, so you can be sure that the ones I DID award 5 stars completely knocked my socks off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cha Cha Sushi&lt;/strong&gt; (San Jose, CA) - Have you ever dreamed of a California Roll topped with salmon, tobiko, house sauce, and then baked to perfection? I have… And my dream came true. This sushi is far from authentic, but that’s not what it’s trying to be. If you ever dreamed of eating wonderfully delicious, hot, deep-fried sushi, you should visit Cha Cha Sushi. I could hype the crap out of this place and you’d probably still be blown away. Come with an open mind, and leave happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cafe Salina&lt;/strong&gt; (Millbrae, CA) - A Hong Kong-style restaurant that has a ridiculously massive menu. I keep coming back and I’ve sampled a huge variety of dishes and have always been very impressed. Even the milkshakes are good! Try their Shrimp and Eggs Chow Fun if you want to try the dish that got me hooked. I also recommend coming in late in the evening (they close at midnight), as they seem to have some logistical issues getting dishes out in a timely manner during regular dining hours. The occasional slow service during peak hours is probably why their overall Yelp rating is not higher. Note that they also recently got a new chef, who customers seem to be impressed by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passionfish&lt;/strong&gt; (Pacific Grove, CA) - A refined restaurant that leaves all that annoying (and unnecessary) snobbery at the door. From start to finish, this place was amazing. When dessert rolled around and I had the best cobbler (Strawberry Peach Cobbler) I’ve ever had, the 5-star deal was sealed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zadin&lt;/strong&gt; (Mission, San Francisco, CA) - Sad to report that this restaurant closed its doors on December 19th. It’s too bad, because it’s a dream for people with dietary restrictions (e.g. vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free). I brought my sister here along with a larger group, and everyone had an equally wonderful meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teixeira’s Bakery&lt;/strong&gt; (Newark, NJ) - For their amazing Portuguese rolls, the location on Kossuth Street gets 5 stars. For the best pasteis de nata (custard cups) I’ve ever had, the Ferry Street location gets 5 stars. New Jersey isn’t as bad as all the haters make it out to be. I’m pretty sure they just never stopped by Teixeira’s Bakery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-01/chinese.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;From top left to bottom right: Deep-Fried Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk (Champagne Restaurant), Shanghai Soup Dumplings and Chives Pancake (Panda Dumpling), Dan Dan Noodles (Yi Yuan), Sautéed Beef and Pumpkin and Cumin Lamb with Onions (China Palace)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.25em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Restaurants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;I ate a lot of Chinese food in 2013. Dim sum is one of my favorite cuisines, so I was always on the hunt for better and better dim sum. Here is the shortlist I give anyone who says they are craving Chinese food; Chinese food varies by region so this list attempts to cover different types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panda Dumpling&lt;/strong&gt; (San Carlos, CA) - Don’t be fooled by the gimmicky name. This place serves up the best Shanghai Soup Dumplings (xiao long bao) and Chives Pancake in the Bay Area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champagne Restaurant&lt;/strong&gt; (Millbrae, CA) - The service here leaves something to be desired, but the food more than makes up for it. Champagne provides dim sum off a menu. My favorite is their Deep-Fried Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk. My girlfriend says these are second-best to the ones she’s had in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yi Yuan Szechuan&lt;/strong&gt; (Millbrae, CA) - For those looking for some spicy Szechuan-style cuisine, drop by this restaurant. Some dishes are incredibly spicy (Lanzhou Beef Ramen) but the menu doesn’t lie when it claims most dishes are “spicy but not numbing.” Check out their very popular Dan Dan Noodles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cafe Salina&lt;/strong&gt; (Millbrae, CA) - All the Chinese restaurants on this list are amazing, but only Cafe Salina earned 5 stars. In the list above, I write about why this place is so impressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Palace&lt;/strong&gt; (Milpitas, CA) - Open so very, very late (3 AM), China Palace may be a bit out of the way, but if you’re craving good Chinese food at odd hours, there is hope. Even when I’ve rolled in around 2 AM this place has been packed. Notably, it was packed with mostly Chinese people, which is always a good indicator of how legitimate the food is!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2014-01-01/bab.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;From top left to bottom right: Benedict a Trois (Town), Swiss and Mustard and Superlative Bread Pudding (The Refuge), Navaratan Korma (Amber India), French Burger with Brie (Cuisinett), Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (Good Mong Kok)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.25em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bay Area Bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;There are some other restaurants that don't fit into the above two groups, but I'm always eager to recommend them as fine dining establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Refuge&lt;/strong&gt; (San Carlos, CA) - The Refuge specializes in thick, homemade pastrami and an impressive beer menu. Come hungry because appetizers will be amazing, entrees will be large and imposing, and you’ll need to save room for the best bread pudding around. Formerly called The Megatron, the bread pudding now goes by the more humble Superlative Bread Pudding. Same mouth-watering deliciousness, however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Town&lt;/strong&gt; (San Carlos, CA) - The priciest of the restaurants featured here, yet I never feel like I’m not getting my money’s worth. They have an awesome brunch menu (weekends only). Consider checking out the Benedict a Trois which gives you Eggs Benedict in three different styles: traditional ham, steak, and crab. I also love their Mom’s Meat Loaf Sandwich, which is pretty huge - even for my big mouth!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Grill Cheese Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt; (SOMA, San Francisco, CA) - Takes the classic American grilled cheese and ups the ante. All their sandwiches are worth a shot, but the Jalapeño Popper is my grilled cheese of choice. They also do gluten-free sandwiches. We’ve already scheduled it as a first stop for when my gluten-sensitive sister visits in the Spring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cuisinett&lt;/strong&gt; (San Carlos, CA) - Imagine a burger draped between two rich slabs of brie cheese. French. Comfort. Food. Also if you’re into wonderful fries, they have french fries sprinkled with truffle oil. Truly magical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amber India&lt;/strong&gt; (Mountain View, CA) - My favorite Indian restaurant ever. The team at Amber India does so many things well; it always breaks my heart when I come for dinner and have to pick a few entrees instead of having access to their lunch buffet. My favorite dishes here are the Butter Chicken and Navaratan Korma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Mong Kok Bakery&lt;/strong&gt; (Chinatown, San Francisco, CA) - This past summer, some friends and I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://markcerqueira.com/2013/07/04/bbq-pork-bun-crawl---san-francisco/&quot;&gt;BBQ Pork Bun Crawl in SF&lt;/a&gt;. Since most bakeries served only baked pork buns, we compared each of the bakery’s baked buns to one another’s, and Victor’s edged out Good Mong Kok as the winner. But Good Mong Kok has an ace up its sleeve: it serves BOTH steamed and baked BBQ Pork Buns! Baked buns are great, but NOTHING beats an amazing steamed bun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;space&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

   <title>Portuglish Words</title>
   <link href="/2013/12/29/portuglish-words/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/29/portuglish-words</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Visiting home, where Portuguese is the dominant language, I am constantly reminded of my deteriorating command of my native tongue. Yet today, I realized that there are words my Portuguese-American family uses that would probably leave my relatives living in Portugal pretty perplexed. These are bastard words: born out of an unholy union between English and Portuguese. I bet most Luso-Americans will know what these words mean, but most Portuguese people will just give you strange looks if you drop one of these gems around them. Here is a small (and very casual) ethnographic look at some uniquely Portuglish words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;liquostore&lt;/strong&gt; - Portuguese people love their libations, yet the proper translation of liquor store is &lt;em&gt;loja de bebidas&lt;/em&gt;. There are far too many syllables there, so let’s just go with liquostore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sneaka&lt;/strong&gt; - Sounds a lot like sneaker and that’s exactly what a Luso-American might call them instead of the proper &lt;em&gt;sapatilhas&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ténis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;zinko&lt;/strong&gt; - This morphing of sink reminds me of transliterated Japanese words that often end in a vowel. You have a sink? A Luso-American has a zinko (zink-koo). A Portuguese person has a &lt;em&gt;pia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parquear&lt;/strong&gt; - Interestingly enough, this was the only verb I could come up with. Used instead of the proper &lt;em&gt;estacionar&lt;/em&gt;, this word means “to park a car.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;estoa&lt;/strong&gt; - This word takes “store” and adds some more vowels to it. The proper Portuguese word for store is &lt;em&gt;loja&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the ones that I could come up with, but I’m sure there are more. If you know any, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Android SDK Trickery</title>
   <link href="/2013/12/24/android-sdk-trickery/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/24/android-sdk-trickery</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to write cringe-inducing code. The other day, I was trying to figure out when the Android keyboard was present and not present. Unlike iOS, Android doesn’t provide convenient ways to detect when the keyboard appears and disappears. I found a “solution” that keeps track of the size of the root view of the activity; if its display frame is smaller than the actual height of the view, a keyboard is likely present. To detect this I added a global layout listener to my root view’s view tree. When I went to remove it, I ended up having to write this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;deprecation&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// no words for this sadness...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;stopListeningForKeyboardDismissal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;SDK_INT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;VERSION_CODES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH_MR1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mRootView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getViewTreeObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;removeOnGlobalLayoutListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mKeyboardPresentListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mRootView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getViewTreeObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;removeGlobalOnLayoutListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mKeyboardPresentListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method remove&lt;strong&gt;GlobalOn&lt;/strong&gt;LayoutListener was introduced in API level 1, but it did not follow the naming conventions in the ViewTreeObserver class. So it was deprecated and replaced by remove&lt;strong&gt;OnGlobal&lt;/strong&gt;LayoutListener in API level 16. What would happen if you didn’t call these properly? Just a NoSuchMethodError exception that would cause much sadness. Good troll, Google. Good troll.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shout Out to GoToMeeting</title>
   <link href="/2013/12/20/shout-out-to-gotomeeting/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/20/shout-out-to-gotomeeting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I first discovered Android’s “Don’t keep activities” developer option, I jumped for nerd joy. You’re telling me I can force the Android operating system to be aggressive and destroy my activities every time I leave them? YES PLEASE. The end result is defensive code that will work better in low-memory situations. Getting all your activities destroyed as soon you leave them likely won’t happen under normal circumstances (more likely to happen on cheaper, low memory devices). But it’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially when you want to keep your customers happy and engaged with your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I decided to give GoToMeeting a try on an Android device and was greeted with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-20/gotomeeting.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Really!?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not even going to mince words; this is Citrix’s development team being &lt;strong&gt;LAZY&lt;/strong&gt;. That option was added so developers could make their apps more stable. It wasn’t added so developers could detect it was turned on and then FORCE users to leave their app and turn it off. And I’m not asking for the moon here because it’s not difficult to make your app work with that option turned on. You’ve got bundled instance state to save any pertinent data that can be retrieved upon activity recreation. Even complex objects can be bundled if you make them implement the Parcelable interface. In a rare moment, the Android SDK actually impressed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t rocket science. It’s caring about making a decent product – something the Citrix team doesn’t seem to care much about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Autumn Animes</title>
   <link href="/2013/12/05/autumn-animes/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/05/autumn-animes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anime is a little known nerd interest of mine. However, I don’t have time to indulge in it as much as I’d like to. Fortunately, these things can be fixed! Over the past few months, I picked out 7 films/shows and took care of some much-needed business. Here are some quick reviews with &lt;strong&gt;watch&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;pass&lt;/strong&gt; recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-titan.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/strong&gt; is set in a medieval setting with one technological advancement: Vertical Maneuvering Equipment that allows humans to move around quickly by latching onto structures, and reeling themselves in. Large humanoid titans - that feed on humans - emerged 100 years ago, and humanity has retreated into a city surrounded by three very tall walls. Humanity’s struggle against the titans is depressing and gruesome; even when humans take a small victory, it is tainted with hopelessness. That said, it’s definitely worth watching if you can stomach lots of slaughter and bone-crushing. There’s another season coming, but I can’t wait so I’m going to read the manga. Verdict: &lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-gc.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guilty Crown&lt;/strong&gt; is a Code Geass clone through and through: a boy meets a strange girl, gets a special power, joins an anti-government group, becomes a hero, then turns evil, and ends up redeeming himself at the end. But there were way too many loose ends at the end of the series. In the end, Code Geass just did everything better, so watch that instead of this. Verdict: &lt;strong&gt;Pass&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-drrr.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durarara!!&lt;/strong&gt; - It seems like it’s a slice-of-life show about a small-town kid moving to a big city. But then it adds a few twists when that city has a headless motorcyclist, demonic possessions, an anonymous Internet-based gang, and humans with supernatural strength. Durarara took a few episodes to pick up steam, but I really enjoyed the show. The plot features a pleasant mix of real-world and fantastical elements that never seemed forced. And while there is your usual protagonist, the show did a great job of exploring and developing the eclectic mix of characters. Verdict: &lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-5cm.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Centimeters per Second&lt;/strong&gt; - An animated feature film that hit me right in the feels. Split into three acts, the film follows a boy named Takaki who grows close to a childhood friend - Akari - who eventually relocates to a different town. The film explores how people grow apart slowly over time, like cherry blossom petals that fall slowly away from each other at 5 centimeters per second. The story itself is troperiffic, but it’s the presentation of this film that really shines. This film is chock-filled with beautiful, awe-inspiring scenes backed by an incredible musical score. Clocking in at barely over an hour, it’s definitely worth checking out. Verdict: &lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-xamd.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xam’d: Lost Memories&lt;/strong&gt; - A story about two warring countries, and a guy who gets some magical powers – who for some reason then proceeds to work on an airship delivering mail. Oh, and occasionally fighting baddies. Seriously, this anime confused me. From the get-go a lot of the characters and their motives were too difficult to grasp, so any development on said things produced little value. The mysterious powers bestowed upon the protagonist are also never fleshed out to my satisfaction. After completing the series I read up on it and the consensus was that Xam’d was good, but not for everyone. I guess I’m one of those that it isn’t for. Verdict: &lt;strong&gt;Pass&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-tengen.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann&lt;/strong&gt; - What starts out as two teenagers escaping their underground village to see the surface world ends up becoming a fight of universal proportions. This show felt like Dragon Ball Z with mechs. Although much shorter in length (27 episodes), whenever there was an insurmountable challenge, you could count on lots of yelling, new power-ups, and fusions. The show is also filled with strong, unique personalities that make even the slower segments enjoyable to watch. A lot of my friends recommended I watch this and I finally got around to it; you should too! Verdict: &lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-tokyo.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Magnitude 8.0&lt;/strong&gt; - The story of two young siblings, Mirai and Yuki, who meet a single mother, Mari, after a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hits Tokyo. The three trudge through the now-destroyed city trying to make their way home safely. Simultaneously a dramatic, sad, heart-warming story that you should watch with a box of tissues near. Verdict: &lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/2013/11/30/passive-video-gaming</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whether you consider video games a means of entertainment or a work of art, video games are consumable goods. Normally, we think of consumers as active gamers. However, since the advent of video gaming, there has been another way to consume video games: &lt;strong&gt;passively&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;Back in the day, this was hanging out at your friend's house while he trudged through Super Mario Brothers. Today, if you just want to sit back and watch some video gaming, you don't even need a friend nearby... or friends at all, if you're not into that kind of thing. Your options are plentiful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch a Let’s Play series on YouTube in which a gamer plays (and frequently narrates) a video game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch someone play a game live online via a streaming service like Twitch TV.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch professionally produced eSports events like the StarCraft 2 or League of Legends Championship Series.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re feeling old-school, find a gamer friend, go to your their house, and kick back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-11-30/passive-sc2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sea of nerds watching a StarCraft 2 tournament.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself an avid video gamer; I plow through a good number of video games per year. Yet, I find myself consuming video games regularly via all the avenues listed above. After a shamefully delayed completion of Chrono Trigger in 2012, I decided to replay the sequel Chrono Cross, but I ended up watching lucahjin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBD691EACF14FB4F3&quot;&gt;Let’s Play Chrono Trigger&lt;/a&gt; series on YouTube instead. And while I enjoy playing StarCraft 2, I definitely watch other people play the game more than I play myself – whether it’s professionals in the World Championship Series or community members live streaming their gameplay. And the options for passive gaming have gotten a significant boost given the PS4 and Xbox One feature live streaming integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve grown up (just a little) and consequently, my time and priorities have shifted. While “active” gaming still occupies a good amount of my time, I find myself turning to passive consumption when I have other things to do (that don’t require my undivided attention) or just want to unwind and do nothing (like a good American boy). When I watch professionals duke it out, I watch because it’s both entertaining and amazing to see people play a game at such a high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-11-30/passive-ta.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Casting Archon Tastosis: Tasteless and Artosis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StarCraft 2 events even feature well-known community personalities, like Tasteless and Artosis, who commentate events. Not only do the actual players competing in tournaments have fans, even the people commentating and hosting these events have large fan-bases! I’ll admit that I would watch Tasteless and Artosis talk about drying paint and probably get a good kick out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think passive gaming is a bad thing. We’ve gotten to the point where watching other people play video games is actually a thing – some people even make a living off of streaming themselves playing! Last year, my girlfriend and I had a great time watching Day[9] drag his pansy ass (and scream like a little girl) through Amnesia - The Dark Descent; it’s a fond memory for both of us even though neither of us actually played the game. He is a braver man than I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-11-30/passive-day9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some fan art inspired by Day9's Let's Play of Amnesia.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s also affecting what games I plan to play in the future. Blizzard’s new trading card game, Hearthstone, has had several months in an open beta. I’ve watched a bunch of people stream it, and even a live competition. When the game does come out, I know I won’t be very excited for it because I’ve essentially sat through a lot of other people’s gameplay and have vicariously experienced the game through them. If I choose not to play it, I don’t think there is a huge loss there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your view on passive gaming? Feel free to share your thoughts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1sklmz/has_passive_gaming_affected_your_gaming_habits/&quot;&gt;r/truegaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait for 2014 to start working toward your goals – &lt;strong&gt;start today.&lt;/strong&gt; I can’t run a marathon today, but I’ve got 40 weeks to sort it all out. I was one of those people who’d make resolutions on New Year’s Eve. And then by the middle of January, I’d be back to my old ways. Come the following New Year’s Eve, I’d be back to make promises I deep down inside knew I wouldn’t keep. Don’t waste any time working towards your goals. And don’t wait for a new year to get started – &lt;strong&gt;start today&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking Kickstarter to Court: Follow Up</title>
   <link href="/2013/10/19/kickstarter-follow-up/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/10/19/kickstarter-follow-up</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I did an audit of all the Kickstarter projects I backed. I found four projects to be extremely behind schedule with posting updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/548200252/help-support-beekeeping-bees-have-a-lot-to-teach-u&quot;&gt;Help Support Beekeeping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1657688528/mars-daedalus-two-a-new-realistic-sci-fi-graphic-n&quot;&gt;Mars: Daedalus Two – A Sci-Fi Graphic Novel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd&quot;&gt;ANIMUSIC 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751892223/the-sons-of-starcraft?ref=live&quot;&gt;The Sons of StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared my findings with Kickstarter, ANIMUSIC, and Sons of StarCraft on Twitter (the other two of the projects aren’t Twitter-cool yet). After all, the Internet is made for sharing your displeasure with as many people as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 680px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-19/ks_tweet.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: It pays to call people out when they have scumbag moments… that last over 6 months. Two of the four rotten eggs have come forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Jeffrey Morris of the &lt;b&gt;Mars: Daedalus Two&lt;/b&gt; project posted an update ten hours after the tweets were dispatched apologizing about the delay in finishing his comic. Jeffrey goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 680px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-19/mars_qq.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCREW THAT, JEFFREY! I gave you money first so what I want takes precedence over EVERYTHING.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. The &lt;b&gt;ANIMUSIC&lt;/b&gt; team sent a much-needed update six days after my blog post claimed they didn't &quot;have an ounce of freaking DECENCY.&quot; The team says they are sorry about the delays and find their backers' desire for more consistent updates understandable. And also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 680px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-19/animusic_qq.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;You're very welcome! Really &amp;mdash; it's MY pleasure! Now quiet down with your excuses and go finish your project.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Who's Behind Bad UX at GOM TV?</title>
   <link href="/2013/10/14/behind-bad-ux-at-gom-tv/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/10/14/behind-bad-ux-at-gom-tv</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-14/gom.png&quot; alt=&quot;GOM TV&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;UI and UX designers battle ferociously to create something that is both beautiful (UI) and a pleasure to use (UX). When I interact with something that isn't gorgeous and functional, I blame a flaw in this holy union. When something is beautiful, but totally hard to use, I blame the UX designer. When something feels awesome to work with, but is freaking atrocious to look at, the UI designer takes the blame. But earlier this week when I went to watch some StarCraft 2 videos, I learned that behind every bad user experience, there isn't always a bad UX designer or UI designer. Sometimes, things are just out of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I unabashedly admit to watching a lot of professional StarCraft. GOM TV, based out of South Korea, has been producing top notch StarCraft 2 content since September 2010 and I’ve been eating it up since then. I catch the videos on demand (VODs) of matches on the days following the actual matches. The other day I logged on to watch the 5th place decider matches. Basically, the 4 players who lost in the round of 8 were competing for the 5th place. There are two matches and the winners of those two matches proceed to a third match. The winner of that third match gets the coveted 5th place prize. When I went to the list of VODs, my experience was less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 680px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-14/gomtv_sc2.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's wrong with this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out this list of videos spoils the result of a match! Recall that Match 3 will be between the winners of Match 1 and Match 2. Who’s that devilishly handsome Korean in the screenshot of Match 3? The winner of Match 1. Knowing who is going to win ahead of time ruins some of the fun of watching Match 1, yet this isn’t an issue of bad UX or UI. It is true that the screenshots themselves are a liability for mistakes like this, but without them, the list of videos would be an intimidating wall of text. Whether these screenshots are generated automatically from the video or someone manually selects the screenshot, this is a case of &lt;strong&gt;content negatively influencing the user experience&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you’re hankering to blame UX designers, you can always play the blame game and argue that they should’ve written specifications that included, “Do not spoil results of matches in preview screenshots.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to bash GOM TV. This is a pretty simple mistake that can be easily corrected. Compared to the other VOD hosting site, Twitch TV, GOM TV does an amazing job at not pissing me off, so hats off to them. I sent a tweet to GOM TV; here’s to hoping they clean this crap up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UX activism &amp;mdash; cleaning up the internet one issue at a time!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Let's Review! Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn</title>
   <link href="/2013/10/10/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-reviewed/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/10/10/final-fantasy-xiv---a-realm-reborn-reviewed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/arr-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Realm Reborn&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I beat the fourteenth entry in the Final Fantasy series, A Realm Reborn. In recent years, the series has received a lot of flak, and the terrible initial release of Final Fantasy XIV only validated these claims. Yet, in their moment of darkness, it seems Square Enix assembled a team of developers who knew exactly what the Final Fantasy series needed. These developers pulled a Phoenix Down out of their bag and threw it on this game. What came back to life was a truly magical gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-10/scions.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join the club. Save the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story -&lt;/strong&gt; Some of you might be wondering, “How do you beat an MMORPG?” Like other games in the Final Fantasy games, story and character development play integral roles in this game. From level 1 to 50, there was a string of required story quests. The struggle against the supernatural primals and the evil Garlean empire was in the end pretty vanilla with a single, somewhat uninspiring twist along the way. While the story wasn’t as enthralling as the non-MMORPG entries in the series, the story did serve its purpose: it motivated me to continue playing. There are also several characters that you will journey with who enhance what would’ve otherwise been an average plot line. In short, the story didn’t make me shed nerd tears, but at times it did make me pretty pumped to kick some Garlean ass as we journeyed forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dungeons -&lt;/strong&gt; Required story missions also included dungeons and trials against tough bosses. I was initially a little worried about this because of my previous experience with dungeons in World of WarCraft. I avoided dungeons because it wasn’t required to progress in the game, and when I did try, I would be in a pick-up group that never seemed able to clear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-10/ifrit.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ifrit's here, but he's not your friendly summon this time around.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 15, you are presented with your first instance dungeon. You are put into a group with three other people, and you face off against tough enemies and powerful bosses. By the time you’re level 20, you will have cleared three dungeons and a trial, which is like a dungeon but consists of only a single fight against an extremely powerful enemy. The dungeon content was difficult, but if everyone did their job and knew the attacks their enemies used, it was a pretty straightforward affair. Later on, the difficulty ramps up; dungeons get much more difficult and trials will feature superbosses that massacre you until you are able to figure out a winning strategy and coordinate your team to execute on that plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-10/stone-vigil.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stone Vigil &amp;mdash; the first dungeon that was truly challenging.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instance dungeons and trials are where I felt this game really shined. Even though MMORPGs compose a small part of the Final Fantasy entries, this game made the entire Final Fantasy experience seem more authentic. Instead of being in charge of a party and calling all the shots, you are put into a team with other adventurers, and put up against grueling challenges requiring coordination and teamwork. It was challenging, but it felt great to complete that dungeon, or beat that tough boss after several wipes. In the beginning, I dreaded the dungeons. By the end, I was RELISHING EVERY MINUTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0J8hUgnfDSk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music -&lt;/strong&gt; The music in this game deserves a shout out as I was highly impressed (read: moved to nerd tears) by several tracks. The dungeons and trials against the primals and Garleans were already epic in difficulty; they were only enhanced by the game’s sick soundtrack. I honestly lost count of how many times I saw “dat music” in the party chat. Above is Fallen Angel, the track played during the grueling battle against the third primal: Garuda. Below is Steel Reason, the track played during the penultimate dungeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B_O9fKzH65o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endgame Content -&lt;/b&gt; When I first decided to play FF XIV, I promised myself I would stop playing once I hit the endgame. Once I hit the level cap and completed the final story dungeon, I happily put the game down. If I were to continue to play, there would be plenty of things to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level up the 8 crafting or 3 gathering classes&lt;/strong&gt; - I really enjoyed crafting. I ended up getting a Goldsmith to level 50 before any other class. I made a bunch of nice equipment (read: friendship bracelets) for myself and my friends, and sold the rest on the marketplace. I also did a bit of gathering which was more of a grind, but could be done as a background task while watching Netflix or something. Having higher level crafting and gathering classes makes you more self-sufficient and also nets you a bunch of gold, which will be useful for those excited for the upcoming housing content patch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level up other classes&lt;/strong&gt; - With 5 classes focused on physical combat and 3 specializing in magic, there are plenty of opportunities to check out and level up other classes. This has more benefits than satisfying your curiosity, as certain classes learn abilities that can be shared between different classes. Also, switching from one type of role to another (e.g. switching from a healer to a damage-dealing class) can give you a chance to run dungeons from a different perspective, and gives you flexibility when helping friends out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get endgame gear, do endgame dungeons and trials&lt;/strong&gt; - The “real” endgame consists of grinding dungeons to get better gear to take on harder dungeons and Hard Mode Primals. The toughest of these dungeons, The Binding Coil of Bahamut, consists of 5 separate “turns” (i.e. mini dungeons) requiring extreme coordination for the entire 8-person party. As of this writing, no one in the world has bested the 5th turn yet! Members of my guild have been grinding away at the endgame content and seem to be enjoying the challenge (and the rewards).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there are plenty of ways I could sink hundreds more hours into Final Fantasy XIV, truuuust me – but for now I’ll just be a “casual player” and wait for the promised quarterly content patches before diving back into Eorzea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-10/magitek.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your reward for completing the story!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts -&lt;/strong&gt; Play this game if you’re a Final Fantasy fan, a fan of MMORPGs, or want an introduction to the MMORPG genre. I am no MMORPG afficionado, but my friends who are say this game is pretty approachable. The game is addicting, challenging, packed with content, and a pleasure to play. There are some quality-of-life issues with the game, but Square Enix seems to be responsive to community feedback. If you’re a Final Fantasy fan on the edge, consider that you get to ride and battle on a Magitek Chocobo mount in the final dungeon! And once you beat the game, you get to use that mount wherever you want – awesome sauce! If you do check this game out, create your character on the Faerie server and shoot me a message so we can play together!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking Kickstarter to Court</title>
   <link href="/2013/10/05/kickstarter-court/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/10/05/kickstarter-court</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-05/ks_logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kickstarter Logo&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;It's time to keep Kickstarter honest. Founded in 2009, Kickstarter is a crowd-funding platform for people with great ideas who need a little capital to make them happen. If you see a project you like, you pledge a certain amount and based on that amount you are promised a reward if the project succeeds. &lt;b&gt;But there's a catch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A project can fail&lt;/strong&gt;; a game developer could misestimate costs and run out of money halfway through development or deals with a manufacturer can fall through. In September 2012, a Kickstarter blog post explained that funding projects on Kickstarter is not like shopping at a store.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; There is always risk, there are always challenges, and people should be aware of that. I’m a Kickstarter junky, so let’s see how well the projects I’ve backed have done so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve backed &lt;strong&gt;43 projects&lt;/strong&gt; on Kickstarter. Of these, &lt;strong&gt;37 have been successfully funded&lt;/strong&gt;. So far, &lt;strong&gt;14 have delivered&lt;/strong&gt; the promised rewards. Generally, most people were &lt;strong&gt;unable to meet their estimated delivery date&lt;/strong&gt;. One project delivered about a month ahead of time, and another delivered right on time, but the other 12 ranged from being a few weeks late to a year late.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Again, Kickstarter is not a store and estimated delivery dates are just that – estimates, and really bad ones at that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves me &lt;strong&gt;waiting on 24 projects&lt;/strong&gt;. Of these, 9 are still in development, but if history is any indicator, most of them will be late. So what about the other 15? They range from being 3 months late to over 19 months late.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, what should be considered acceptable and unacceptable? I looked at when each project last posted an update. Updates are emailed to all backers to give them more insight into a project’s status. I’ll be lenient: if a project creator has given us an update within the last 6 months, they’re in the clear. If they have not, well, come on – stuff happens, but updating your funders once every half-year isn’t too much to ask, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 15 late projects, 4 haven’t posted one single update within the past six months. Let’s take a look at each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/548200252/help-support-beekeeping-bees-have-a-lot-to-teach-u&quot;&gt;Help Support Beekeeping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (12 months late, &lt;strong&gt;last updated 7 months ago&lt;/strong&gt;) - Look Sheryl, I know from your last update 7 months ago that you need to drive your dad to dialysis three times a week and now you need to get that knee replacement surgery you’ve been putting off. I’m sorry, but you said yourself that “problems are no excuse for taking so long to get everyone’s rewards out to them.” It’s been 7 months, Sheryl. I hope your dad is doing well. I hope your knee is okay. And I hope you are able to tell me when I’m going to get my honey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1657688528/mars-daedalus-two-a-new-realistic-sci-fi-graphic-n&quot;&gt;Mars: Daedalus Two – A Sci-Fi Graphic Novel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (7 months late, &lt;strong&gt;last updated 7 months ago&lt;/strong&gt;) - The last time I heard from Jeffrey Morris, he sent out a preview of the comic he’s working on. He told us his “company has taken some huge strides” since receiving funding and are developing “seventeen additional sci-fi comic book titles.” You know what Jeffrey? I don’t think you can make seventeen comics if you can’t make ONE FREAKING COMIC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd&quot;&gt;ANIMUSIC 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (10 months late, &lt;strong&gt;last updated 7 months ago&lt;/strong&gt;) - This one is too funny. In the last update from ANIMUSIC, Wayne says, “I felt bad about not getting the CD done on schedule” and “I felt bad about wasting useless mental energy on feeling bad.” You know what, Wayne? You should feel bad and THEN SOME. You raised over $200,000 for your project and not only are you 10 months late, you don’t have an ounce of freaking DECENCY to tell the 3,284 backers how the project is going.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751892223/the-sons-of-starcraft?ref=live&quot;&gt;The Sons of StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (12 months late, &lt;strong&gt;last updated 12 months ago&lt;/strong&gt;) - Jeffrey Alejos raised over $42,000 to film a documentary on the two preeminent StarCraft casters: Tasteless and Artosis. Tasteless and Artosis even plugged this project multiple times during their casts. A year ago, we got a trailer and a claim that “the film is scheduled to be released in Spring 2013.” With Fall 2013 around the corner, still no updates from Alejos. Just give me my documentary already!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One quick update would have kept these projects off this list. For Christ’s sake, a guy – Edward – with brain cancer posted an update apologizing for his video game project being late.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; His health has been on a roller-coaster ride, yet Edward, who is going through pain I can’t even imagine, still has the common courtesy to update his supporters. You can do it, too. &lt;strong&gt;Kickstarter is not a store, but it’s also not a charity drive.&lt;/strong&gt; You tell us your ideas, we give you support, you do your thing, and we reap some reward – like video games, cool wallets, yummy burger sauce, or at the VERY least, good feels – for helping you. What you don’t do is take people’s money and disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status overview of the Kickstarter projects I've backed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is Kickstarter risky? My experience suggests that a few people may just take your money and run, or something akin to what the 4 projects above have done. But generally, most people seem to be making steady progress, and most will take longer than planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does Kickstarter help hold project creators accountable? Not well. All the data I used to write this post was compiled&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; by myself since Kickstarter does not provide any tools to track progress on backed projects. I would suspect, though, based on my own experience with projects, that if Kickstarter made this data readily available, the numbers would not look good. In a glance, backers would feel like they’re losing money, and that is never good for business. So instead, they just write blog posts telling potential backers that there is always risk – covering their own butts, but helping me none.  &lt;strong&gt;As always on the interwebs, proceed with caution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mission Accomplished</title>
   <link href="/2013/10/01/mission-accomplished/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/10/01/mission-accomplished</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did some running leading up to the Spartan Beast in early August, and while I’m no junky for runner’s high, I ended up really enjoying that portion of my training. Following the Spartan, I kept running, and as August came to a close, I decided to give myself a challenge: &lt;strong&gt;run 100 miles in September&lt;/strong&gt;. Previously, my longest distance covered in a month was about 70 miles, so the goal here was to increase distance. Armed with a playlist of Final Fantasy battle music, I can trick myself into doing anything. Well, October’s here already, so this is how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 760px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-10-01/run_log.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;September's Running Log&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;I use MapMyRun to track my runs. It lets me know how far I've run, how fast, and maintains a history of all my workouts. Tracking my runs fulfills a nerdy sense of satisfaction. Here are some stats for September:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total distance&lt;/strong&gt;: 100.24 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of runs&lt;/strong&gt;: 18&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average distance per run&lt;/strong&gt;: 5.56 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average pace&lt;/strong&gt;: 9:05 minutes per mile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longest run&lt;/strong&gt;: 13.17 miles (half marathon, baby!) on 9/2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories burned&lt;/strong&gt;: ~12,800 calories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I barely made the mark, but I’m happy to say – &lt;strong&gt;mission accomplished&lt;/strong&gt;! October’s goals are less concrete, but still involve running. I want to do runs where I focus on moving faster and keeping all my splits comfortably under 9 minutes. I also want to incorporate some high intensity interval training to work on building a more robust endurance. See you in a month, and happy training!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Not Being Fat Anymore</title>
   <link href="/2013/09/16/on-not-being-fat/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/09/16/on-not-being-fat</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;used&lt;/strong&gt; to be really fat. At my worst, I weighed 255 pounds and my doctor was telling me I should do something about my high cholesterol and high blood pressure – an indirect way of telling me I’m a fat ass. And then I did something about it. Today, I’ve lost a third of my former self, have the blood pressure of an athlete, and my doctor can finally stop looking for medical euphemisms for “fat ass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 520px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-16/fat.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have some secret diet or exercise plan. I just started &lt;strong&gt;eating less, moving more, and lifting heavy things&lt;/strong&gt;. Progress is slow and takes time; &lt;strong&gt;nothing magical will happen overnight&lt;/strong&gt; or even over a month. Weight loss is a never-ending journey: I’ve reached my goals, but continue to remain vigilant about my health because I absolutely refuse to go back. For the first time ever I feel comfortable in my own skin, and I only want to get stronger. I’m challenging myself to run longer and faster, to improve my kendo, and to lift heavier. In short, &lt;strong&gt;it feels good&lt;/strong&gt;, so I’m going to keep being healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Initial Impression of Final Fantasy XIV</title>

   <updated>2013-09-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/arr-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Realm Reborn&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;After a botched release of its second massive multiplayer online RPG (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix shut down the game and went back to drawing board. Two years later, the development team has returned with a great game, appropriately titled A Realm Reborn. I never played the original version of FFXIV, but have played the latest version since its release. The first week was a little rough, given Square Enix's servers were having trouble handling all the traffic, but things are all good on that front now. After two weeks filled with exploring the world of Eorzea, I must admit I'm impressed...and hooked! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/ffxiv_locations.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The world of Final Fantasy XIV&lt;br /&gt;Clockwise from top-left: Ul'dah, Limsa Lominsa, Gridania, Eastern La Noscea&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any Final Fantasy game, story plays a huge role in this game. There are cutscenes and mandatory story quests that must be completed to unlock additional content. And this isn’t some loose story that dissipates after a few hours; you’ll be going through story quests from level 1 to level 50. Depending on the class you choose, you’ll start in one of three major cities on the Eorzean continent: the verdant forest nation of Gridania, the ocean-side swashbuckling Limsa Lominsa, or the arid mining city of Ul’dah. A few hours in, you’ll have explored one of these cities in depth and visited the other two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/garlean_empire.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The leaders of the Garlean Empire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, you’ll learn about the antagonists of this tale. Interestingly enough, the shutdown of the failed original version plays a role in the story. The shut down is portrayed as The Calamity. The evil Garlean Empire (FFI reference to the antagonist Garland) makes a push to conquer Eorzea. Similar to Sephiroth casting Meteor in Final Fantasy VII, the Garleans cause one of Eorzea’s moons, Dalamud, to fall toward Eorzea. As Dalamud approaches, the primal Bahamut emerges from within the moon and devastates Eorzea. A Realm Reborn picks up five years after The Calamity, when your character must contest with the encroaching Garlean Empire, and the overwhelming threat of the primals (summons). The Garlean Empire is like the Gestahlian Empire in Final Fantasy VI: an advanced technological nation with Magitek seeking to conquer others for access to their resources. There will be plenty of the usual MMORPG filler: go kill this monster, go collect this item, and go deliver this package to some inconvenient location. But the story always seems to kick in when this filler starts to get tedious – hooking you right back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/ffxiv_classes.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Art for the Marauder, Alchemist, Botanist, Warrior, and Thaumaturge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class system is extremely flexible. There are 5 fighting classes, 3 magic classes, 8 crafting classes, and 3 gathering classes. All these classes are treated equally, and you switch between them by simply switching your weapon. For example, you can fight your way to a mineral node as an Archer, switch to a Miner to harvest resources, and then switch over to an Armorer to craft new equipment. To unlock jobs (specialized classes) you need to get a class to level 30 and another to level 15. I started off as a Lancer, hoping to eventually become a Dragoon, which requires a level 30 Lancer and level 15 Marauder. When I began leveling my Marauder, I found I enjoyed playing a tank class much more, so I stuck with Marauder to 30, got a Gladiator to 15, and now have unlocked the Warrior job. Switching classes is encouraged, easy, and most importantly doesn’t require creating new characters or losing progress. Aside from just checking out new classes for fun, you can learn abilities in those alternate classes that other classes can then use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/ffxiv_battle.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Lancer at work.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gameplay itself is fun and approachable. Raiding dungeons is introduced in the story quests; these aren’t difficult, but do require that everyone on the team play their role properly. That said, Square Enix is catering to more hardcore MMORPG players by providing Hard mode versions of dungeons and boss fights, with even higher difficulties slated for future expansions. New mechanics (e.g. materia socketing, battling chocobo companions) are introduced roughly every 10 levels, so if you feel overwhelmed with the amount of stuff you can do at level 10, it’s only going to get worse (in a good way)! The battle system is standard, but enemies will sometimes telegraph attacks by projecting danger zones, giving you a chance to avoid the attack by getting out of the zone. In dungeons, there are even limit breaks – so if you’re a black mage, you can finish off an enemy with the Meteor spell! Crafting is surprisingly addictive: I find myself spending most of my time collecting resources and then crafting items to use, sell, and share with friends. Nobou Uematsu composed the soundtrack to the original version, and Masayoshi Soken took over for A Realm Reborn. I’m not sure how much material was borrowed from the original version, but this game has some really great music: some that pays tribute to the classics, some that are fresh, and others in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/chocobo.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your chocobo will get you places faster, and even fight with you!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some rough edges to this comeback tale. The inventory management system is a bit unwieldy, but I could be facing the worst of it because I have been dabbling in all of the crafting and gathering classes. The Gear Set system, which easily allows you to manage different equipment sets for different classes is helpful, but could be more useful by telling you which items in your Armory Chest (a special equipment bag) is part of a set. Cleaning up my inventory and Armory Chest has taken up more time than I’d like to admit. The world is also currently inundated with spammers looking to sell gold, but Square Enix has a team dedicated to cleaning up all this noise. There is also a bit of lag and synchronization issues with the server, which results in you getting hit by a telegraphed enemy attack, even though you moved out of the danger zone in time. Square Enix is aware of many of the issues gamers have voiced, and has been very vocal about what they’re currently working on, so the future looks bright for this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/ffxiv_fierlaine.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;My character profile.&lt;br /&gt;Note my penchant for gathering (Disciples of the Land) and crafting (Disciples of the Hand).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently just passed level 30 and unlocked the Warrior job. I’ve gone through the three introductory dungeons, as well as the next three in the story quest, fought a few primals, and am having a blast so far. I’ve spent a good amount of time gathering and crafting, which I find to be really interesting. My friends who are playing alongside me are also admittedly hooked, one going so far as to say “this game is like crack.” Square Enix plans to release major content updates quarterly so “game completion” will likely be an ephemeral state for most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of checking out FFXIV, create a character on the &lt;strong&gt;Faerie&lt;/strong&gt; server, and add &lt;strong&gt;Marcus Fierlaine&lt;/strong&gt; so we can play together. Happy adventuring!  If have any questions about FFXIV or want me to discuss any other elements of the game, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Working at a Zoo</title>
   <link href="/2013/08/20/working-at-a-zoo/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/08/20/working-at-a-zoo</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In high school, I was fortunate to be part of the Science Explorers Program at the Newark Museum. Founded in 1995, this program was part of the YouthAlive! national initiative, which aimed to “provide positive work and learning opportunities for young people.” During my three years in the program I got to participate in cool science workshops, field trips to national parks, a sightseeing tour of Washington DC, an annual fundraising gala, and even had my portrait painted by an artist. But most importantly, I got to spend three years working in a zoo! &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Pictures of me in high school, incoming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-20/zoo.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sights from the Newark Museum Mini Zoo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mini Zoo at the Newark Museum featured over one hundred animals spanning roughly fifty different species. “Mini” is certainly warranted as we only had nine public-facing animal enclosures and did not feature any large animals: our largest resident was an 8-foot long, 60 pound Burmese Python called Bernie. We had a lot of animals behind-the-scenes that were used for educational programs at the museum. Some of my favorites at the zoo were Blanca, an Umbrella Cockatoo; Digger, a Fennec Fox; Ginny, a Virginia Opossum; and Dave, quite possibly the oldest Rock Dove Pigeon ever. The team of keepers managing the zoo was likewise pretty small: there were two full-time animal keepers, a part-time keeper, and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-20/blanca.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me and Blanca (Umbrella Cockatoo) at her birthday party.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure the ramp up program for a high school student with no experience handling or caring for animals involves a lot of vetting. During the school year I did one four-hour shift each weekend and my first few visits involved reading up on all the animals in the zoo, and common rules regarding care and handling animals. After that, I spent three months in the kitchen. A trusty binder covered, in very great depth, all the dishes I had to prepare. Growing up hating vegetables and greens, I got pretty good at differentiating them. I later found out that three months in the kitchen usually bored most aspiring animal keeper interns, who eventually would just transfer to a different part of the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 350px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-20/ginny2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me and Ginny (Virginia Opossum): the only friendly opossum I know!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that, the list of tasks I could be given slowly grew. After three months in the kitchen, I started carefully placing food in the animal habitats. Once, a mongoose must’ve thought my hand was food because he took a quick nibble at it! Then, I started cleaning the animal habitats, and that’s &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of what animal keeping is about. It’s not about hanging out and giving animals food. It’s about making sure animals are in safe, clean environments, are eating their food, and regularly going to the bathroom. In short, there’s &lt;strong&gt;tons of looking for and cleaning poop&lt;/strong&gt;, and poop is important because it says a lot about the health of an animal. There was also time for play and enrichment, to provide a stimulating environment and to enhance their general well-being. Still, sometimes animals would poop during play time. Eventually, I was doing everything the full-time keepers were doing – working full-time during my summers and having a blast along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-20/ginny.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ginny (Virginia Opossum) liked to poop a lot, but never pooped on me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss my days at the Mini Zoo; when I started college, I dropped by the zoo every time I visited home to see my keeper friends and animal friends. I wish I could urge everyone to go visit the Mini Zoo, but unfortunately during the budget crisis in 2010, the Newark Museum decided to close down the zoo. It seems they gave the keepers only two days notice, and kept only one person to take care of and find new homes for the animals. I felt terrible for this person, as well as the animals: one person could &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; do everything required to properly care for them, without even considering the time it takes to find them new homes! I really am grateful to the museum for the wonderful experience I had during my time there. But the closing of the Mini Zoo – and particularly how that closing was handled – just stinks, and leaves a really bitter taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rapid Reviews</title>
   <link href="/2013/08/15/rapid-reviews/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/08/15/rapid-reviews</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a busy month filled with work, kendo, eating, exercising, a Spartan race, and of course plenty of video gaming. The past month has been extremely generous with releases on both console and especially handheld platforms. So far, there has been a mix of hits and duds. Here are some rapid reviews of the games I have checked out over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;ProjectXZone&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/ProjectXZone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Project X-Zone box art&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Project X-Zone (3DS)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, I was really excited for Project X-Zone. Come on -- how could a strategy RPG featuring characters from heavy-hitting Capcom and Namco series not be awesome? Two hours into X-Zone, I put it down. Although I gave the story barely any time to develop, the core of the game -- battling -- was just boring. I didn't feel like I had to plan out every move (like in Final Fantasy Tactics) to avoid getting wiped out. I was just moving my characters around the map, easily cleaning up the bad guys over and over again. While I'm glad quirky games like X-Zone are getting localized, this particular one really let me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/smt_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV box art&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Shin Megami Tensei IV (3DS)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;My JRPG portfolio is disappointingly lacking in games from Atlus's Shin Megami Tensei series. So I dove headfirst into SMT4, and found the experience to be simultaneously rewarding, enjoyable, frustrating, and depressing. The game is definitely challenging: I was punished for using the wrong elemental spell by getting massacred immediately afterward by &quot;smirking&quot; monsters. Towards the end of the game, I resorted to abusing the reflect damage spells to defeat powerful enemies. However, the gameplay was solid; I enjoyed exploring each area, recruiting and fusing monsters to build my personal army of henchmen. Regarding plot, SMT4 doesn't tell a happy story. Exploring post-apocalyptic Tokyo, you'll experience the worst humanity has to offer. Depending on your choices throughout the game, you'll get one of a few endings, all of which are sure to disappoint the optimists out there. That said, I highly encourage anyone looking for a solid JRPG to check this game out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;Tales of Xillia&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/xillia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tales of Xillia boxart&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Tales of Xillia (PS3)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;Twenty hours in, Xillia is looking to be another solid entry in the Tales series. In Xillia, you get to choose between two main characters: a fisticuff-wielding honors medical student called Jude Mathis, or the Lord of Spirits in sword-toting human form, Milla Maxwell. When the main characters are together, you'll experience the same story, but when the characters split up, you experience the story from the perspective of your character. The opening hour of the game aside, the characters have spent most of their time together, so I don't see myself replaying the game to get the other character's perspective. The new additions to the already solid Tales gameplay are refreshing. The Lilium Orb resembles Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid, and allows customization when powering up characters. Materials collected while exploring are used to expand shops, which then unlocks more powerful items. The already solid action-oriented Tales battle system now has Linking, which allows two characters to link up for all sorts of benefits. The story so far appears to be your standard JRPG story where some evil person has a super powerful weapon and you're tasked with destroying it. All the main characters are interesting, and I'm curious to learn more about them. I'm not even done with Xillia, but am already excited for the stateside release of its sequel in 2014!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;Dragon's Crown&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/dragonscrown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dragon's Crown boxart&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Dragon's Crown (Vita)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;From Vanillaware, the creators of Muramasa, I saw Dragon's Crown as a spiritual successor to Muramasa. I found improvements, but sadly, along with disappointments. Addressing Muramasa's hearty dose of backtracking, Dragon's Crown features a central hub town, and then a gate that allows players to fast travel to the different dungeons they explore. While this is awesome, the gameplay just doesn't feel as polished or smooth as Muramasa. Moving my character around feels clunky. Having to hold down a button to run, which is incidentally also the button to attack, seems dumb to me. Being able to recruit three NPCs or friends to play with you sounds good in theory, especially since monsters in dungeons are too powerful to be conquered alone. That said, with three other characters on the screen, I keep losing track of my character during the busy battles. With other strong offerings on handheld devices, Dragon's Crown has moved into the &quot;paused&quot; game backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;Mario &amp;amp; Luigi Dream Team&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/dreamteam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mario &amp;amp; Luigi Dream Team boxart&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Mario &amp;amp; Luigi: Dream Team (3DS)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;I've avoided checking out the Mario &amp;amp; Luigi series because I felt that it just wouldn't compare to its spiritual predecessor -- Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars -- which is one of my favorite games. That said, I decided to give Dream Team a try. Three days later, I'm six hours in and loving every minute of it. The story is light, funny, and of course features Peach getting kidnapped early on. Mixing platformer and RPG elements, the gameplay is fun and engaging. The battle system is turn-based, but involves a lot of action when it comes to getting critical hits and dodging enemy attacks. The game holds your hand a bit too much early on, but the tutorials fortunately taper off as you get through the opening chapter of the game. While it's similar yet different from Super Mario RPG, I'll admit I've made a mistake ignoring the Mario &amp;amp; Luigi series if all the entries are as awesome as Dream Team is shaping up to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>The Mysterious Research Department</title>

   <updated>2013-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/30/research-department</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I got a cold call from a recruiter: Jeff. I gave him my usual response to recruiters, “Sorry. I’m happy at Smule. If things change, I’ll reach out to you.” Yet, Jeff deserved a little more than this. After all, he somehow dug up my phone number. My interest piqued, I naturally asked Jeff how he got my number. Jeff proudly said, “&lt;strong&gt;Our Research Department&lt;/strong&gt;. For candidates we are highly interested in, &lt;strong&gt;Our Research Department&lt;/strong&gt; gets their info.” Well, Jeff and other people who like to cold call innocent nerds, here’s a tip for you. In today’s world, where email and text messages are the norms for communication, I only expect calls from family and friends. If you’re a recruiter and you think calling me is going to woo me, you might as well greet me with a big “&lt;strong&gt;SCREW YOU&lt;/strong&gt;” because if you’re going to piss me off, you might as well do it with a bang. If you want to grab my attention, &lt;strong&gt;send an email&lt;/strong&gt; with something more than a generic copy-and-pasted message. I’m all over the Internet, so get your Research Department to figure out what I like, and use that to grab my attention. I didn’t tell Jeff to put me on his do not call list; I’m hoping this post gets the message across. Have a good day, Jeff!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Concert Review: Video Games Live, San Francisco, 7/26/13</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/28/video-games-live-concert-review/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/28/video-games-live---concert-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-28/logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Video Games Live&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;On your typical cold summer evening in San Francisco, nerds gathered at Davies Symphony Hall to listen to the SF Symphony and Chorus perform the best kind of music: video game music. Video Games Live is a concert featuring music from popular video game franchises, with video footage accompaniment, synchronized lighting, and even interactive segments for the audience. I grew up playing video games, and still play them today. Yet, video game music plays an even larger role in my life. I listen to video game music at work, I run and work out to video game music, I listen to covers of video game music on YouTube, I write these blog posts listening to video game music, and I count down the days to the release of the next Final Fantasy soundtrack remake. With this kind of passion for video game music, I figured there was absolutely no way Video Games Live could disappoint me. Boy, was I wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-left&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-28/tallarico.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tommy Tallarico&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;Tommy Tallarico, creator and producer of Video Games Live, made the unfortunate mistake of also making himself emcee and electric guitar frontman for the concert series. Tallarico came off as an obnoxious egomaniac. While he seemed like a good musician, his parading around with his electric guitar in front of a world-class symphony really cheapened the entire experience. After intermission, there was a codec call from Solid Snake. I became giddy about the incoming music from Metal Gear Solid (MGS), but instead heard Snake rally the audience to introduce not the SF Symphony -- but Tallarico. The guy could not stop hogging the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Video Games Live’s website, Tallarico is described (very likely self-described) as “&lt;strong&gt;one of the most successful video game composers in history&lt;/strong&gt;.” Wow, I thought – maybe he isn’t a total hothead, and actually deserves to be in the pantheon of greats like Yasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu, Motoi Sakuraba, and Koji Kondo. Nope – not the case. While Tallarico certainly has an impressive list of games he’s worked on, a large majority are games that I’ve never heard of. Although SpongeBob SquarePants The Movie sounds like a game that has to make its way to my backlog ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, the lighting setup was &lt;strong&gt;terrible&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m not sure which was worse: Tallarico, or the in-your-face, seizure-inducing lighting. Perhaps the lighting team did not understand that no, this was not a rock concert. They also forgot there were people on the upper tiers, because the bright lights were often pointed directly in our eyes. The first time this happened, I face palmed, and realized that this was coincidentally really effective at protecting my eyes. When the lights were not pointing at us, they were still doing plenty of damage; the performance of Liberi Fatali (Final Fantasy VIII) was great, but was absolutely ruined by the violently strobing lights. It’s not as if the musicians could not get across Liberi Fatali’s incredible intensity by themselves; they did. The frenetic lights only did them a disservice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-28/vgl.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If he could play guitar, conduct, and flash lights at my face at the same time, I bet he would!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to music, unfortunately the selection of arrangements was poor, and the passable execution by the SF Symphony and Chorus did not redeem this doomed concert. The Mega Man arrangement suffered from a lack of music from the Mega Man X series; for once, I was actually hoping to see Tallarico shred the Intro Highway Stage Theme of Mega Man X. The inclusion of music from Assassin’s Creed IV and Destiny was uninspiring and had &lt;strong&gt;business partnership&lt;/strong&gt; written all over it. The performance of the Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross arrangement featured a terrible arrangement and performance of Time’s Scar. During the violin solo, Tallarico insisted on standing in front of the soloist, who then became barely visible in addition to already being barely audible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly can’t fault the SF Symphony and Chorus; if I worked with Tallarico on a concert featuring mediocre arrangements and an insanely aggressive light show, I’d have a real hard time taking it seriously. &lt;strong&gt;Recommendation?&lt;/strong&gt; If you want a whirlwind introduction to live video game music, are not prone to seizing, and can stand rampant showboating, check out Video Games Live. Otherwise, pass on it, and check out a Zelda Symphony or Distant Worlds concert instead.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Retrospective - Fast-Grinding in Video Games</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/23/retrospective-fast-grinding-in-video-games/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/23/retrospective-fast-grinding-in-video-games</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-23/smt_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV Box Art&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;I have been working my way through Shin Megami Tensei IV (SMT4) on my Nintendo 3DS. This series is known for being notoriously difficult, and the latest entry carries on this tradition. As is common in Japanese RPGs (JRPGs), when you get stuck, you grind to power up your party. Grinding is oftentimes a long and arduous process; among my friends who aren't fans of JRPGs, grinding is a common complaint. Coincidentally, there seems to be a new trend emerging to cut down on grinding. Developers, including the ones behind SMT4, are releasing downloadable content (DLC) that allows players to grind more quickly. Here, I reflect on how fast-grinding has changed JRPGs for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast-grinding saves a ton of time.&lt;/strong&gt; If I get stuck fighting an enemy and I’m already exploiting their weaknesses, it’s time to grind. Instead of spending an hour fighting weaker enemies ad infinitum, I can now quickly power up my party, and get back to conquering my earlier roadblock. Once I’m a few hours into a game, I’m normally committed to completing it. Lately, with awesome games coming out left and right, cutting down on grinding propels me through games faster, and avoids intensifying the anxiety I get from &lt;em&gt;video game backlog&lt;/em&gt;. For example, SMT4 came out on July 16th and Tales of Xillia (PS3) comes out on August 6th. With fast-grinding available in SMT4, I’m confident I can get through the game before Xillia comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If fast-grinding is used, it shouldn’t break the game.&lt;/strong&gt; After grinding in some games, I can mindlessly spam attacks, since most enemies are now comparatively much weaker. In SMT4, even after grinding several levels, I was not an all powerful demigod. After some fast-grinding, battles do become a bit easier; but if I stop paying attention for even a second, I still find myself on the Game Over screen. Via a system of elemental resistances and weaknesses, SMT4 brutally punishes bad strategies, even against weak enemies. &lt;em&gt;Grinding shouldn’t break games, and fast-grinding shouldn’t break games faster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But something awesome and intrinsic to JRPGs is lost.&lt;/strong&gt; There is something twistedly rewarding about grinding. Investing time to power up your party to beat that tough boss gives value to your hard (and often tedious) work. With fast grinding, it’s like winning the lottery every time you run out of money; it quickly takes care of a problem (not having money), but you have something you really didn’t work hard to earn (unless you consider picking numbers hard work). Taking down an über-powerful superboss might not feel very satisfying when it only took a few hours of fast-grinding to build your victorious party. You’ll save time with fast-grinding, but &lt;em&gt;time spent grinding can give value to your gaming experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think &lt;strong&gt;fast-grinding is a great complement to JRPGs&lt;/strong&gt;, and including it is a smart move on developers’ part. So far, I’ve seen it available in SMT4 and Fire Emblem: Awakening (3DS) as paid DLC. The good thing is fast-grinding is not only optional, it costs money, so you always have a good excuse to grind the old fashioned way – which I sometimes prefer. However, while I get joy out of watching characters in games grow, both in story and in stats, I find myself wanting to fast-grind more often than before. Maybe it’s because I’m not a kid anymore; I’ve grown up and lost that nostalgia-inspiring ability to fully dedicate myself to a game. Not to mention, I’ve lost the spare time. So I’m grateful that JRPGs are growing up alongside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got an opinion on fast-grinding? Feel free to share your thoughts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1iyxra/whats_your_opinion_on_fastgrinding_dlc_in_jrpgs/&quot;&gt;r/truegaming&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1iyxrl/whats_your_opinion_on_fastgrinding_dlc_in_jrpgs/&quot;&gt;r/jrpg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>LinkedIn's 2.5-Factor Authentication</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/17/linkedin-2.5-factor-authentication/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/17/linkedin-2.5-factor-authentication</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;float-image-right&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn for iOS&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px;&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;p&gt;Almost a year after its password database was hacked, LinkedIn finally enabled two-factor authentication. Unlike single factor authentication that requires only something a user knows (a password), two-factor authentication also requires something the user possesses. This can be a cell phone that will receive an additional piece of information to prove that you are, in fact, you. LinkedIn's two-factor authentication uses your password and a randomly-generated code that is sent to your cell phone, which is common practice and used by companies like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox. &lt;b&gt;The way&lt;/b&gt; LinkedIn presents its two-factor authentication is where the company really shines... And not in a good way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/dbauth.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2-factor authentication on the Dropbox iOS app.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look at how Facebook (version 6.3) and Dropbox (version 2.3) handle two-factor authentication on iOS. You start by entering your email and password. If those are correct, you’re past the first stage of authentication. You are informed that your phone will be sent a code (the second piece of authentication), and then you’re brought to a screen with a number pad. You receive a text message with the promised code and are able to input the code. After passing two methods of authentication, you’re in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/fbauth.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2-factor authentication on the Facebook iOS app. Note the inconsistency with which Facebook refers to the security code.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is simple and clean, aside from Facebook being inconsistent in what it calls the security code: the app states that you will get a &lt;strong&gt;code&lt;/strong&gt; via SMS, then calls that code a &lt;strong&gt;password&lt;/strong&gt; in the SMS, and then asks for a &lt;strong&gt;Login Approval Code&lt;/strong&gt; in the app. Dropbox keeps things much more consistent: stating a &lt;strong&gt;security code&lt;/strong&gt; will be sent to your phone, calling that code a &lt;strong&gt;security code&lt;/strong&gt; in its text message, and then asking for a &lt;strong&gt;6-digit code&lt;/strong&gt; in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s take a look at LinkedIn (version 6.1). Everything starts out similarly. You enter your email and password, and if those are correct, you proceed to the next step of authentication. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/liauth.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wait... I have to do what!?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why would they have me append my security code to my password – in the same field!?&lt;/strong&gt; Their iOS team forgoes implementing a new screen, the server team picks up the slack and separates the security code from the password, and the user is left dumbfounded as to why LinkedIn took an entire year since their password leak to send two-factor authentication to an alternate realm of terrible user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least the instructions in the app and the text message are consistent; let’s just follow the instructions and be finished with this. I dismiss the UIAlertView by hitting the OK button, the text message comes in with the code, I switch to the numeric/symbol mode of the keyboard of which I will only use the numbers, and I carefully input the first number. Lo and behold, my password that was formerly there is gone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/liauth2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just when you thought things couldn't get worse...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. When the text message says &lt;strong&gt;Enter your LinkedIn password followed by: 123456&lt;/strong&gt;, whether by accident or design, it literally means type your password in &lt;strong&gt;AGAIN&lt;/strong&gt;, but add these 6 digits to the end. Perhaps this is some new hybrid of 2-factor authentication – enter your password, and then enter your password again, but add a security code to the end. It’s silly. You don’t need to sacrifice convenience for added security. So for now, I’ll just assume this is a big joke on LinkedIn’s part…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 297px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/liauth3.jpg&quot; /&gt;

   <title>My Biggest Video Game Time Sink</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/12/time-sinks-final-fantasy-x/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/12/time-sinks---final-fantasy-x</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The editors at Game Informer recently did a feature series on games they’d spent a huge amount of time playing: &lt;strong&gt;time sinks&lt;/strong&gt;. The games ranged from new games like Minecraft to classics like Pokémon Red and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I’ll unabashedly admit that I have spent an obscene amount of time playing video games. This shouldn’t come as a surprise considering my favorite genre is Japanese RPGs (JRPGs), which usually take at least 20 hours to get through the main storyline. I put 122 hours into Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii) and 60+ hours into Dragon Quest IX (DS) and Valkyrie Profile(PSX). But there is one JRPG on the Playstation 2 that I played for a staggering &lt;strong&gt;227 hours&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a Final Fantasy fan. My first hit was Final Fantasy VIII (PSX). Through repeated playthroughs, one involving collecting all the cards in the Triple Triad card game, I easily put in over 90 hours into this game. I even got Squall’s second best weapon before the first SeeD mission, by refining the cards I collected into the items necessary to make the powerful gunblade. But 90 hours pales in comparison to the 227 I invested in the first Final Fantasy released on the PS2 – &lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-11/227hours.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;227 hours!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of ways to pour time into FFX. I got the powerful Celestial Weapons. I took the worst Blitzball team in Spira, the Besaid Aurochs, and turned them into dominant tyrants. I dodged 200 lightening bolts in the Thunder Plains. The Monster Arena also quickly ran out of monsters that could even scratch my party. That said, even doing all this could not account for 227 hours. One day I stumbled on a GameFAQs guide to max out characters’ stats… And I took the dive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-11/ffxstats.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top: &lt;/strong&gt;Maxed out stats for Tidus and Yuna.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-left: &lt;/strong&gt;Yuna's Aeons benefiting from her maxed out stats.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-right: &lt;/strong&gt;The Sphere Grid -- heavily modified to max out stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick overview of how you do this. In FFX, you power up your characters by fighting enemies to earn points, which allows you to collect power ups from the Sphere Grid. On this grid, there are various nodes that grant various power ups to your characters (e.g. Magic up, Strength up). Some nodes are more powerful than others. For example, you can have a node that only increases Strength by 1 and another that increases it by 4. Special items also enable you to modify the sphere grid. For example, with a certain item, you can erase nodes. On the other hand, certain monsters drop items which allow you to create nodes that award the max boost for each stat. From here, it’s just a matter of erasing every node that does not award the maximum boost to a particular stat and replacing it with a node that does. Rinse and repeat until you max out the 8 bits allocated to each stat – 255.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? I think the completionist in me took over and went into overdrive. Aside from not maxing out Luck to 255, the only disappointment is that I played the North American version of FFX. The International Version of FFX, released only in Europe, features tough superbosses that would’ve been fun to challenge (i.e. destroy) with my maxed out characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 594px; border: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-11/ffxhd.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's almost time to play this game some more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Final Fantasy X isn’t done consuming my time! An HD remaster of Final Fantasy X is quickly approaching. But this isn’t a plain old remaster of the version I played on the PS2. This is the International Version that features those aforementioned superbosses, and even some brand new content. These days, I don’t replay games because my video game backlog is huge and life has gotten busier compared to my halcyon days. But it was during those days that I heard Tidus deliver the first lines of this game, “Listen to my story… This may be our last chance.” Well, I guess I can make an exception. Sign me up – we’re going to Spira again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post inspired a great discussion that made it to the top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1i5va2/which_ff_have_you_played_for_the_longest_time_any/&quot;&gt;r/FinalFantasy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1i60a5/which_jrpg_have_you_played_for_the_longest_time/&quot;&gt;r/JRPG&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks to the Redditors who shared their biggest time sinks; your excitement is contagious!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Android Library Am I On?</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/09/what-android-support-library-am-i-on/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/09/what-android-support-library-am-i-on</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
	table, td, th {
		border: 2px solid gray;
		margin: 0 auto;
		padding: 6px 12px 6px 12px;

	}
	td {
		text-align: center;
		font-size: 0.66em;
	}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google maintains some handy support packages that allow older versions of Android to use otherwise unavailable APIs. It’s a win-win for most - developers can support older devices more easily, Google looks great because they are making developers’ lives easier, and Android users aren’t forced to upgrade their phones to have access to a large selection of apps. There are losers, and one of them is me: the developer who looks at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html&quot;&gt;revision history&lt;/a&gt; for the support library and realizes there may be relevant fixes in newer revisions. I need to figure out which revision I’m on now, so I look in the &lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt; folder, see the support library &lt;strong&gt;android-support-v4.jar&lt;/strong&gt; and ask myself, “What is the version of this support library?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filename of the JAR itself yields nothing; v4 simply refers to the minimum API level supported by that particular library. The manifest file of the JAR disappointingly does not have any information. Fine; let’s grab the MD5 checksum. But what to do with this checksum? Google’s Android documentation does not provide checksums for the different revisions of the library. Launching the Android SDK Manager, I find revision 13 installed in my Android SDK bundle, but the checksum of that revision does not match the checksum of the mysterious library currently sitting in my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s go through all the previous versions and get checksums for them. But wait… I can’t downgrade my support library via the Android SDK Manager! The revision history page also doesn’t have any download links for older revisions. Although Google has done a poor job of putting download links in a visible place, it has fortunately done a good job of maintaining their revisions in an orderly manner. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/support_rXX.zip&quot;&gt;this URL&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the rXX with the version of the support package you want (e.g. r04 through r13 as of July 2013). After grabbing all available revisions, I created a table filled with the support libraries’ MD5 checksums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;margin-bottom: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;Revision&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;v4 library MD5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;v7 library MD5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;v13 library MD5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;86dfb3c6ac2db479ff396906fe4ee1be&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7aa30cf7bb854e98670e3b5ad9b15f87&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6ed7cfa457967cb8d5924c93b96847e7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4e4868c990252855cc14b8ac83656172&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bcf017dfe2243c8d72b4b2aa40101040&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;43715e49c8c89f1c844cbb3cc1a4638d&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;c6c2148762c614d3bad120ca01491e34&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0a796c18e64c30b0cb64b1802dcb022b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;abdf04d97d538c7425e0314b21767e87&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7c357558b1ef5cd16f1d312fe87c38a0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;102ca4ff9de8c0294a42987dbee92e58&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4adc2acf706396225495c43bb60cbb78&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7b5efe58fd28cbc7fa8f9e88ab9c7d65&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;64a88c9b9cd7d755498984c5034a81c9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2a7dd0b32bef6da952f9adea5dbab998&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9974894df6e8ba95bb27f5e85e2cdfb5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;a94112d8249a193143ec19d35f11552a&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;98b359e98f5c7407432877c88d1cd2f3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5dce8843261486180715e459d953885d&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;63dcac01d302b2a2b6479dfb4496b070&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2aceba35370fa10721e8af40decb1955&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, we were using revision 6 of the v4 support library. Between this and the latest version, new functionality was added and “many [Fragment] bugs” were fixed. We use Fragments in a few places, so we’re pushing ahead with the upgrade. Figuring out what version you are using shouldn’t be this difficult. Some might argue that developers should do book-keeping on the libraries they are using. But if you’re dedicating resources to putting out and iterating on packages used by many, you could at least invest some time to attach relevant metadata to those packages. In this particular case, involving a JAR file, setting up a manifest file with a bundle version is both easy for those creating the packages and helpful for those using the packages. In the meantime, the JAR file has been renamed to &lt;strong&gt;android-support-v4-rev13.jar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Upgrading to Jackson 2.0</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/07/upgrading-to-jackson-20/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/07/upgrading-to-jackson-20</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, the first major update to the JSON processing library, Jackson, was released. Smule’s Android team uses Jackson for manipulating JSON, but until recently, we were using version 1.9. While version 1.9 worked perfectly fine, I took some time to get us on the latest and greatest Jackson has to offer. The upgrade to 2.0 is not as trivial as swapping JAR files, so here are some tips for a successful upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This post is a supplement to my &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/05/26/tips-for-android-json-parsing-using-jackson/&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; about using Jackson that applied to version 1.9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;1. Updating JAR Files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were previously using 2 JAR files: &lt;strong&gt;jackson-core-asl-1.9.4.jar&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.4.jar&lt;/strong&gt;. The 2.0 update reorganized how Jackson is packaged so you’ll want to now use these 3 JAR files: &lt;strong&gt;jackson-annotations.jar&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;jackson-core.jar&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;jackson-databind.jar&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember to update your IDE project settings and any build scripts to use these new JAR files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;2. Fixing Imports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from things getting shuffled from 2 to 3 JAR files, the Java package names have also been updated for from &lt;strong&gt;org.codehaus.jackson&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson&lt;/strong&gt;, so you’ll need to update import statements. My favorite Android IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, makes this easy. Don’t touch anything after updating the JAR files, try to compile, remove all the missing import errors, and let IntelliJ’s auto-import feature handle all the grunt work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;3. Get the &quot;get&quot; out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fixing all the import statements, don’t be alarmed by the number of errors you may still be seeing. You likely just need to remove the word &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; from a bunch of places. For example, JsonNode methods in 1.9 like getBooleanValue(), getFields(), getElements(), getIntValue() have dropped the get in 2.0 to become booleanValue(), fields(), elements(), and intValue().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;4. Parsing JSON Arrays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will still have lingering compiler errors if you were parsing JSON arrays. In Jackson 1.9, you could parse an array of objects like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setSubjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsonArrayNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsonArrayNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TypeReference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jackson 2.0, the &lt;strong&gt;readValue&lt;/strong&gt; method now takes as its first parameter a &lt;strong&gt;JsonParser&lt;/strong&gt; instead of a &lt;strong&gt;JsonNode&lt;/strong&gt;. Going down my hierarchy of compiler-error-problem-solving, I first looked through header files and futzed around a bit to no avail. I turned to Google and Stack Overflow, but couldn’t find any solutions. So I posted a question on Stack Overflow and implemented this temporary solution, which manually iterates over the JsonNode containing our array of objects and parses each object in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setSubjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsonArrayNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsonArrayNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;objectMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;treeToValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jsonNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the hour, an answer was posted. Turns out, the trick is to simply call &lt;strong&gt;traverse()&lt;/strong&gt; on your JSON ArrayNode before passing it to &lt;strong&gt;readValue&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;readValue&lt;/strong&gt; method throws exceptions, so I created a new helper method in my JsonUtils class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// helper method to make JSON array parsing a one-liner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;parseJsonList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TypeReference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;typeReference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;defaultMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;traverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;typeReference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TAG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Failed to parse JSON list &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;typeReference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new method, we can now easily parse our JSON containing an array of objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson 2.0 adds some cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/Presentation-Jackson-2.0&quot;&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt; that we’re not planning to use yet.

   <title>BBQ Pork Bun Crawl - SF Edition</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/04/bbq-pork-bun-crawl-san-francisco/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/04/bbq-pork-bun-crawl---san-francisco</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On July 4th, I celebrated my homeland’s birthday by embarking on a search with friends for the very best pork bun… Welcome to the BBQ Pork Bun Crawl - San Francisco Edition! BBQ pork buns (叉烧包, char siu bao) are Cantonese-style buns filled with barbecue pork – They are also absolutely delicious! Yelp reviews and Google searches were inconclusive when it came to determining where to find the best pork buns, so we took to the streets of San Francisco to find out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-04/pork_bun_collage.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bakeries from left to right. Top: Wing Lee, Red House, Garden, Lung Fung.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom: Good Mong Kok (steamed), Good Mong Kok (baked), Golden Gate, Victor's.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;We visited eight bakeries across several San Francisco neighborhoods. You can check out my individual &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/list/bbq-pork-bun-crawl-sf-san-francisco&quot;&gt;reviews on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;, but here is the quick lowdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great:&lt;/strong&gt; Good Mong Kok (Chinatown), Lung Fung Bakery (Richmond), Victor’s Bakery (Sunset)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good:&lt;/strong&gt; Garden Bakery (Chinatown), Red House Bakery (Excelsior), Wing Lee Bakery (Richmond)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meh:&lt;/strong&gt; Golden Gate Bakery (Chinatown)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTF?!:&lt;/strong&gt; Mee Heong Bakery (Chinatown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first bakeries we went to was Golden Gate Bakery in Chinatown. They’re known for their fresh Chinese Egg Tarts. In my eyes, they’ll also be known for their terrible pork buns, as they were easily the worst pork buns we sampled. The bread was dry and crusty, the meat was hard, and the sauce was uninspiring. Buns came with barely any meat, and what little there was was often tucked away to one side. Golden Gate Bakery should stick to what it’s great at (Chinese Egg Tarts) and consider taking this sad excuse for a pork bun off the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like we were off to a poor start, but the Chinatown bakeries soon redeemed themselves through the memorable &lt;strong&gt;Good Mong Kok&lt;/strong&gt;. First, a note that BBQ pork buns come in two varieties: steamed (蒸, zheng) and baked (烤, kao). Steamed buns are usually only found at dim sum restaurants, but Good Mong Kok offered both! The fact that they also served fantastic pork and vegetable buns made this our favorite bakery for the first half of our journey. If you’re looking for a good variety of pork buns, this is the place to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last stop of our Chinatown excursion was particularly memorable. &lt;strong&gt;Mee Heong Bakery&lt;/strong&gt; was out of pork buns when we walked in. I’d normally make a note to come back later, but as I peered into the dimly lit bakery, I noticed a pair of pigeons strolling around inside. Just chilling, and no store owner in sight. Congrats, Mee Heong Bakery – you earned yourself a big &lt;strong&gt;WTF?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop on our list was the Richmond District. We had the luck of tasting some great pork buns here as well. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/list/bbq-pork-bun-crawl-sf-san-francisco&quot;&gt;Yelp reviews&lt;/a&gt; cover these in more detail. After Richmond, stomachs achingly full, we journeyed to the Sunset District where we found… the best of them all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can only be one, and &lt;strong&gt;Victor’s Bakery&lt;/strong&gt; in the Sunset is the bakery to rule them all! Their pork buns had the perfect amount of fluffy bread – just enough to give you that softness you love, yet with enough room for a generous serving of delicious, chunky meat. Surprisingly enough, Victor’s was the last bakery we visited; I expected the bakeries at the end of our itinerary to suffer from our absolute lack of appetite. But Victor’s prevailed over that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-04/pork_bun_winner.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Group photo with the &lt;i&gt;BBQ Pork Bun Crawl&lt;/i&gt; winner: Victor's Bakery in the Sunset!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An adventure wouldn’t be a great one without a little variety! On our way from Richmond to the Sunset, we made a pit stop at &lt;strong&gt;Tea Way&lt;/strong&gt; for some refreshing bubble tea. We also enjoyed some perfectly seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth popcorn chicken at &lt;strong&gt;Let’s Roll&lt;/strong&gt; next door. After we chose our pork bun champion, we took a walk down Taraval Street and ate some refreshing gelato from &lt;strong&gt;Marco Polo’s&lt;/strong&gt;. After that point, all our hungers had been satiated and it was time to go home. As I began to drive back, one of my friends caught a glimpse of the &lt;strong&gt;Chairman Bao&lt;/strong&gt; food truck from &lt;strong&gt;Off The Grid&lt;/strong&gt;. I almost ran the car off the road in excitement. Literally: everyone in the car gave a little scream as the car swerved back and forth. With a little patience, we found the food truck and sampled some of their amazing Taiwanese-style bun sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-07-04/side_quest.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We ate other delicious things along the way!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBQ Pork Bun Crawl was an excellent way to spend a day off – Good friends and good food always make for a great time. While the six of us agreed on the ratings I’ve included on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/list/bbq-pork-bun-crawl-sf-san-francisco&quot;&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt;, that’s only our opinion. If we should give a place a second shot or we completely missed an amazing place, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt;! This crawl may be over, but we’re already looking forward to the next time we scour the city for amazing food.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Staying Dry with Android Layout Files</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/03/staying-dry-with-android-layout-files/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/03/staying-dry-with-android-layout-files</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are countless Android device types out there. The Android OS can load resources based on a device’s screen size and pixel density. This is useful when you want different user experiences for larger tablets versus a smaller handset. The system works as intended, but what if you want the exact same layout with a few minor tweaks? Maybe you want a list item to be 40% taller on tablets, or maybe you want less padding around an image on smaller devices. Google provides thorough documentation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html&quot;&gt;supporting multiple screen sizes&lt;/a&gt;, but does not offer an elegant solution for tweaking layouts across device sizes. You could support multiple layout files for different classes of devices, but that’s a pain to maintain given the minor differences across layout files. Fortunately, there is a way to stay DRY (don’t repeat yourself) with your layout files!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have a basic list item that shows information for a song. It has an ImageView to show the album art and a TextView to display the song’s title. Our layout file in the &lt;strong&gt;res/layout&lt;/strong&gt; folder looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;com.company.ListItem&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;match_parent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;50dp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:background=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@color/list_item_background&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ImageView&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_gravity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;center_vertical&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@drawable/album_blank&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;TextView&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_gravity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;center_vertical&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_marginLeft=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;4dp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:textColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@color/song_title_text_color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:textSize=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;14sp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:text=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@string/default_song_title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/com.company.ListItem&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;Our trusty designer reviews the implementation on various devices and comes back with these requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the entire list item 20% taller on tablet devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a larger margin to the left of the song title.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the text size of the song title larger on tablets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could make a copy of the layout file and put it in the &lt;strong&gt;res/layout-large/&lt;/strong&gt; folder, tweaking the values as requested. You may even need to do this for &lt;strong&gt;res/layout-xlarge/&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;res/layout-small&lt;/strong&gt;. Copying, pasting, and tweaking are all easy, but any subsequent updates to the layout requires changing multiple layout files. If we added a TextView to our list item to show the name of the artist, we’d be copying and pasting that TextView into each instance of our list item layout file. In the end, repetition becomes frustrating, and maintenance becomes time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re already familiar with the key to avoiding this copy-and-paste madness: the &lt;strong&gt;values&lt;/strong&gt; folder. You likely already use it if you define string and color constants. In the example above, we used the following values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;resources&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- color values --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list_item_background&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;#ecebea&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/color&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;song_title_text_color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;#222222&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/color&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- string values --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;default_song_title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Song Title&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/resources&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the configuration qualifiers you can append to &lt;strong&gt;res/layout&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;res/drawable&lt;/strong&gt; to support multiple devices also works for the &lt;strong&gt;values&lt;/strong&gt; folder! You can define &lt;strong&gt;dimen&lt;/strong&gt; resource values that can store values with units like dp and sp. For example, in the layout file above, we could change the height of our list item from 50dp to &lt;strong&gt;@dimen/list_item_height&lt;/strong&gt; and then we could define this &lt;strong&gt;dimen&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;values&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;values-large&lt;/strong&gt; folders. We repeat this for each of the requests made by our designer, and end up with two files (in &lt;strong&gt;res/values&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;res/values-large&lt;/strong&gt;) that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- res/values/list_item_values.xml --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dimen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list_item_height&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;50dp&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dimen&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dimen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list_item_song_title_left_margin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;4dp&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dimen&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dimen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list_item_song_title_text_size&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;14sp&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dimen&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- res/values-large/list_item_values.xml --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dimen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list_item_height&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;60dp&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dimen&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dimen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list_item_song_title_left_margin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;8dp&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dimen&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dimen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list_item_song_title_text_size&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;20sp&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dimen&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we can have a single layout file. Android can load different layout files for different devices, and the values loaded also follow the same set of rules. You can even define a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt; to have different values, which may be useful for displaying longer strings on tablets. All those copies of your layout file can now be discarded and replaced with this single file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;com.company.ListItem&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;match_parent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@dimen/list_item_height&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:background=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@color/list_item_background&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ImageView&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_gravity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;center_vertical&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@drawable/album_blank&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;TextView&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;wrap_content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_gravity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;center_vertical&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:layout_marginLeft=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@dimen/list_item_song_title_left_margin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:textColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@color/song_title_text_color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:textSize=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@dimen/list_item_song_title_text_size&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;android:text=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;@string/default_song_title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/com.company.ListItem&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;So now you can avoid repeating yourself, but you are adding a level of indirection. At Smule, we've avoided any indirection-induced pain by following these book-keeping practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prefix the name of the value with the name of the layout file that’s using it (e.g. song_list_item_, song_list_activity_).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re sharing values across multiple layout files (e.g. the height of a navigation bar shown everywhere in the app), use some special prefix for those shared values (e.g. shared_).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep device-dependent values in a separate XML file as opposed to just having a single file in the values folder. Things like strings and colors will unlikely vary across different devices, so keep those in a separate file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps anyone who’s looking to maintain their Android layout files more easily. Huge kudos to Stack Overflow user, kennethc, who discovered this functionality and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12616321/android-how-do-you-manage-multiple-layout-files-in-line-with-dry-principle&quot;&gt;posted about it&lt;/a&gt;. If there is any additional magic to managing multiple layout files, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll update this post!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>June Reading Marathon!</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/01/june-reading-marathon/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/01/june-reading-marathon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While in college, the time I spent reading for pleasure tapered off. Unfortunately, it never really picked back up. This made me sad given there are such great books, both old and new, out there. I reddit a little (a lot) and the redditors over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/books&quot;&gt;r/books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi&quot;&gt;r/scifi&lt;/a&gt; are always recommending great books. So in June I made a concerted effort to spend more time reading. While the previous books I’ve read over the past year were all science fiction, I tried to vary up the genres of books this time. Now that June has flown by, here are the books I read and my thoughts on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Forever War&lt;/em&gt; (1974) by Joe Haldeman - This novel starts off as your typical science fiction describing an interstellar war between humanity and an alien species. But rather than get bogged down in the technology and battles between the two sides, this novel dives into the lives of soldiers after their fighting is done. The futuristic setting allows a broadening of this exploration via time dilation, which greatly lengthens the time soldiers spend in combat relative to those who do not fight in the war. This is due to the soldiers often traveling near the speed of light, which “slows down their time.” Our story follows a soldier who spends two years fighting, but returns to an Earth where decades have passed. The novel originally served as a metaphor for the Vietnam War, but seems very relevant to the issues facing all of our veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&lt;/em&gt; (1968) by Phillip K. Dick - A seminal science fiction novel that explores a world in the near future where the line between man and machine has become extremely blurred. The concepts and themes explored extend beyond man vs. machine in such a well-woven manner that it doesn’t feel like the author is trying to force some higher message down your throat. The plot is relatively straightforward, and given the brevity of the work (~200 pages), the author does not attempt to fit a grandiose plot into too short a text – which is refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&lt;/em&gt; (2003) by Mark Haddon - It’s been so long since I’ve read such a great, light-hearted book! Haddon’s mystery novel centers around Christopher, a young boy who describes himself as having some “behavioral difficulties,” and his journey to solve the murder of his neighbor’s dog. Although many people liken Christopher’s behavior to Asperger’s or autism, Haddon claims the book is “about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way.” Haddon described Christopher’s point of view so well that as I read the novel, I found myself frustrated with how he was responding to situations. Those moments of frustration became important moments of reflection on how we should respect the fact that everyone does not think and act like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/em&gt; (1899) by Joseph Conrad - The list of classic movies I haven’t seen is as shameful as the list of classic books I haven’t read. Reading this short novel got one book off that list, but I honestly did not enjoy it much. Conrad’s tale explores themes of corruption, colonialism, and racism in the larger context of imperialism. It felt like something your high school English teacher would assign to you because its many themes are very relevant to world history, and while I’ve really enjoyed plenty of assigned reading, the themes here are so blatant that the plot seems to take a backseat to it all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foucault’s Pendulum&lt;/em&gt; (1988) by Umberto Eco - Someone on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/books&quot;&gt;r/books&lt;/a&gt; subreddit described this book as “a thinking man’s Dan Brown. [A] group of guys make up a conspiracy on a whim, then can’t convince the conspiracy theorists it’s not real.” This book describes what Dan Brown must feel like as he strings together some harebrained conspiracy, loosely grounded in some historical texts, for his latest best-selling novel. Don’t get me wrong – I’m a sucker for the occasional conspiracy theory book, but Eco’s work shows how dangerous it can be to breathe life into a lie, which Brown’s novels invariably do for some people! This was the longest read in June and took a while to get through, but I still recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July is upon us and I already have a list of books I want to read next. As a Computer Science major and now Software Engineer, I can get by without 100% proper grammar and syntax. But I’ve started actively &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V4unpKMFq8kSHDMw2UW9rQ&quot;&gt;Yelping&lt;/a&gt; (and blogging here), and want my writing to be totally legit and proper. So I’m going to read &lt;em&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eats, Shoots &amp;amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I want to revisit two of my favorite books from my childhood: &lt;em&gt;The Wind in the Willows&lt;/em&gt; by Kenneth Grahame and &lt;em&gt;A Wrinkle in Time&lt;/em&gt; by Madeleine L’Engle. Next on the list is a bit of professional development with &lt;em&gt;Design for Hackers: Reverse Engineering Beauty&lt;/em&gt;, which I hope will give me some insight into how the great designers I work with at Smule think! Last is a book written in Portuguese; I’m leaning towards Jose Saramago’s &lt;em&gt;Ensaio Sobre a Cegueira&lt;/em&gt; (Essay on Blindness) –  a novel on the social effects of an epidemic that turns everyone in a city blind.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Things I Learned Growing Alongside Smule</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/26/things-i-learned-growing-alongside-smule/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/26/things-i-learned-growing-alongside-smule</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Boy, does time fly… My three year anniversary at Smule is quickly approaching! I started at Smule right after college, and both Smule and I have grown a lot since then. From 3 years ago to today; 18 team members grew to 60+; we now develop for iOS and Android; switched from SVN to git; from waterfall to Scrum; from Lighthouse to Pivotal to JIRA; grew from a team relying on scant documentation to one utilizing a comprehensive wiki. Overall, Smule and I have become better and a tad bit smarter at what we do. I feel like I’ve learned a lot, and even picked up a controversial opinion or two! Here is a selection of observations, thoughts, and opinions I picked up growing alongside Smule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid writing sloppy code - a.k.a. hacking or “getting it done” - because you actually think stuff will get done faster.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, you can copy-and-paste that chunk of code that does what you want from one class to another. But extracting that functionality into a superclass or creating a helper class might be better, and it won’t take a significant amount of time, especially if you use a decent IDE. When this code is revisited, the time you invested doing things in a better way will pay dividends. This isn’t school anymore as you’re never really “done” with any piece of code. I’m definitely not advocating over-engineering: just responsible coding and kindness to your fellow developers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need some release engineering – the more, the better.&lt;/strong&gt; We used to compile our app store builds on our product lead’s laptop. We used to have QA compile code on their machines. So much pain (iOS provisioning madness) can be avoided as soon as you set up a machine that can create the builds you need, and notify developers ASAP when they push code that breaks the build. Yes, you could spend that time “getting it done,” but remember that release engineering is the gift that keeps on giving!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document stuff!&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the code you just designed, wrote, and debugged makes complete and total sense to you. But writing a comment here and there doesn’t take that much time, and will help anyone who may come in to understand your code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid overreacting, especially if you’re flying blind.&lt;/strong&gt; After releases, we used to monitor app store reviews for any negative feedback. We still do, but we no longer go to DEFCON 2 (e.g. a Cuban Missile Crisis) when a review complains about an issue. We’ve integrated frameworks (in our case, Crittercism) that lets us monitor issues affecting our customers. We then use this data to plan fixes for future releases. Our products have gotten more stable – you can see the crash rate fall from release to release – and we can make much smarter decisions on whether an issue deserves a hot-fix or can be deferred to the next scheduled release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back up!&lt;/strong&gt; This is advice for anyone who uses a computer. It’s a matter of time before some tragedy renders your computer unusable. Even if code is hosted on a remote repository or all your important files are in the cloud, setting up a new machine to your liking still takes time. On Macs, it’s incredibly easy to back up (and recover) with Time Machine. Everyone at Smule is regularly reminded to stay backed up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is responsible for product quality – so if you see something, say something!&lt;/strong&gt; QA is primarily responsible for ensuring our products meet a standard of quality. That said, we have encouraged the entire team to speak up if they see anything odd. It’s not the Smule engineering team putting out our apps: it’s the entire Smule team. We all want to deliver the best experience to our customers, so we’re all doing our best to strive for that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop, test, and play with a proxy.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re not using Charles or some other proxy while working with an app: get it, learn it, and use it. Sometimes issues that involve a client-server interaction become a finger-pointing contest between the two teams. With a proxy, you know exactly what the client is requesting and what the server is sending you, which helps debugging issues immensely. Power users can use Charles to throttle their connections to slow speeds, intermittently drop packets, and even overwrite data being sent back from the server.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay out of your comfort zone. Don’t stop learning.&lt;/strong&gt; Around my two year anniversary at Smule, I needed some change. I had been doing iOS for two years, most of it on Magic Piano, and felt like I wasn’t really growing and learning as much as I’d like to. Different people prefer different things; some people don’t mind more of the same, but I become frustrated when I felt like I was stagnating. Instead of sulking, I asked if there was any room to shuffle me around. My reinvigorating shift to the Android team gave me an entirely new mobile platform to learn and explore. Instead of siding with iOS in the iOS vs. Android battle, I can now comfortably tell you what I like and dislike about both platforms! I’m now hoping we have our Windows Mobile team set up by summer 2014 so I can make another switch! Then, followed by a Blackberry team. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be kind.&lt;/strong&gt; At my baccalaureate service, Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, said something very poignant: “One day you’ll understand that it’s harder to be kind than clever. Cleverness is a gift; kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy – they’re given after all. Choices can be hard.” I have the occasional bad day, and I sometimes hear and see things I completely disagree with. During those moments, Bezos’ words ring absolutely true: it is harder to be kind, but it’s certainly the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A happy team is a productive team.&lt;/strong&gt; Like most startups, Smule has pretty awesome perks – including tons of food, awesome workshops, StarCraft 2 Day, and great work hours including work-from-home days. While we’ve grown a lot and added some common-sense planning and release processes to eliminate some of that startup chaos, the perks and flexibility have not changed. If you have to pick up your furry friends from the vet, drive your brother for the third time to the DMV because he can’t pass his road test, or you pulled your back doing deadlifts (all real examples), no one is going to be hunting you down. Flexibility has kept our team happy and productive, and we’re all getting awesome things done in and out of the office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smule and I have come a long way together: we’re full steam ahead on our mission to bring the world together with the power of music, and I’m excited to see where our wild journey goes. If I said something that stirred emotions within you, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send feedback in 140 characters&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out Smule on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smule&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Smule&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for more awesomeness. Smule was recently listed as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-index-apps-may-2013/&quot;&gt;top 10 publisher on iOS&lt;/a&gt; (excluding games), in the company of big names like Google, Apple, and Facebook!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Game I'm Most Excited For</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/22/the-game-im-most-excited-for/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/22/the-game-im-most-excited-for</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/06/16/video-games-after-e3/&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about my excitement for upcoming 3DS games, but I’m also excited about games coming to all consoles. The &lt;em&gt;Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is in my PS3 and I’m eager to start playing it. This game has received immensely positive reviews and supposedly grossed more than The Man of Steel during its opening weekend! The new open world, photorealistic graphics, and new Jack Bauer voice acting for Snake make me giddy to embark on Hideo Kojima’s newest chapter in the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; Versus XIII has transformed itself from vaporware into the fifteenth entry in the series. Few details, trailers, and gameplay videos have been revealed, but I’m hoping Square Enix doesn’t screw up the first entry of their flagship series on the next generation of consoles. &lt;em&gt;Pikmin 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful 101&lt;/em&gt; give the Wii U a much-needed boost to its somewhat lackluster library. These are a few of the games I am looking forward to, but the one game I absolutely cannot wait to get my hands on is a gem that will be coming exclusively to Nintendo’s Wii U.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6GxUMMGyZcM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monolith Soft’s &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; was not revealed at E3 but instead during a Nintendo Direct broadcast for the Wii U in January. Details on X are sparse but it appears to be a sequel (if not story-wise, at least spiritually) to the Wii game &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;. Xenoblade is one of my all-time favorite games that revived my faith in JRPGs. I put a good 120+ hours into the game and definitely went through a bit of separation anxiety when I realized I had played the game to its end. Two of my coworkers picked up Xenoblade after I kept raving about it. Midway through gaming, John said it was interfering with his ability to get anything done, so he brought the game disc to work and read a plot summary on Wikipedia to avoid getting sucked in again. Josh did things properly (he completed the game), and agrees that Xenoblade is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 600px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-22/xenoblade-areas.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some of the different areas you explore in Xenoblade Chronicles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw this trailer, all of the amazing memories and feelings I got playing Xenoblade came flooding back - I might’ve shed a few tears of joy. The trailer shows off beautiful and vast open world environments. Even on the Wii, Xenoblade had environments that were an absolute pleasure to explore. I remember the first time I arrived in Xenoblade’s first large free-roaming area: the huge grassy Gaur Plains. I ignored all the story objectives and just ran around to every nook and cranny of the map, dying a few times because some of the enemies were very strong. It was just fun to run around and explore – something I find missing in a lot of games. Traveling from area to area revealed new and varied landscapes to explore like the swampy Satorl Marsh, snowy Valak Mountains, and dense vegetation of the Makna Forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/APWTJMyM4qg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During another Nintendo Direct that coincided with E3, a new trailer revealed more interesting environments and gameplay footage. This trailer heavily featured mechs, both for exploring and doing battle against very large dinosaur-like enemies. While the mechs in Xenoblade were never able to be piloted, it appears X inherited from its older predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Xenogears&lt;/em&gt; the mechanic to allow players to pilot and fight in mechs. The addition of flying mechs, as well as beautiful and potentially larger open-world environments, has me brimming with glee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music in Xenoblade was top notch. The composing trio ACE+ did a great job composing pieces day/night pieces for each of the areas (check out the Guar Plains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xweRl4LZlmo&quot;&gt;day music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftmSuJqbdx0&quot;&gt;night music&lt;/a&gt;), awesome battle music (check out the guitar-laden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCclUgQk1Lk&quot;&gt;Mechanical Rhythm&lt;/a&gt;), and very moving pieces that complemented the progression of the story (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0DE5zyRI6U&quot;&gt;Unfinished Battle&lt;/a&gt;). The first trailer for X reveals that the music will be composed by Hiroyuki Sawano whose discography features plenty of work on movies, anime, and TV shows. X will be Sawano’s first video game, but if the music to the two trailers released is any indicator, I am eagerly anticipating checking out X’s soundtrack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that Monolith Soft can deliver an experience that will top Xenoblade! The wait may be long as no release date has been announced, but I’ve got some awesome games to tide me over in the meanwhile. &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is fired up and the always reliable Tales series brings &lt;em&gt;Tales of Xillia&lt;/em&gt; to the US in early August. It might also be a good time to revisit the &lt;em&gt;Xenosaga&lt;/em&gt; trilogy that I put down somewhere in the second chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Game Console I'm Most Excited About Post-E3</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/16/video-games-after-e3/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/16/video-games-after-e3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting annual events in the video game world, the Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) was held last week. A lot of the focus this year was on the two new console juggernauts - the PS4 and Xbox One - but there were plenty of exciting game announcements for current and next generation systems as companies vied for gamers’ attention (and money). Established series revealed information on new entries including giants like Metal Gear Solid, Mario Kart, Final Fantasy, Halo, Super Smash Brothers, Call of Duty, Kingdom Hearts, and Battlefield. It’s certainly a good time to be a gamer! After a week filled with exciting news, I thought about the console I am most excited to game on in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;Both going into and coming out of E3, I am most excited for Nintendo's handheld 3DS. My 3DS is already hogging up most of the time I spend gaming! Having spent a ton of time playing &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Awakening&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/em&gt;, I am currently playing through &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Returns 3D&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;. Not only is the current 3DS game library awesome, the games in the release pipeline are looking to secure the 3DS as my go-to gaming system. Here are the ones I'm most excited for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;ProjectXZone&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-16/ProjectXZone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Project X-Zone boxart&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Project X-Zone (06/25/2013)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;Pronounced Project Cross Zone, this tactical RPG features a diverse set of characters from Namco Bandai, Capcom, and Sega franchises. Here are a few from series I have played in the past: KOS-MOS and T-elos (Xenosaga); Megaman and Zero (Mega Man X); Dante (Devil May Cry); Yuri, Flynn and Estelle (Tales of Vesperia); Kite and BlackRose (.hack); Chris and Jill (Resident Evil); Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li (Street Fighter); and Selvaria Bles (Valkyria Chronicles). I checked out the demo for this quirky RPG and had a great time playing through it. I'm looking forward to diving into this game next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;pokemonX&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-16/PokemonXBoxart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pokemon X boxart&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Pokémon X / Pokémon Y (10/12/2013)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;It's been far too long, old friend! The first and last Pokémon game I played was the original Pokémon Red. The series has evolved a lot since the late 90s when Professor Oak gave me a choice between a Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle (I chose Bulbasaur!), and then sent me off to catch the 151 Pokémon known to exist. While there have been many new regions, new Pokemon (Pokémon #649 is Genesect), and new gameplay elements, for the first time in the series, the entire game is going to be presented in fully polygonal 3D graphics. I plan to at least finish the story, while resisting the urge to try to catch em' all so I can play other games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;zelda&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-16/Zelda_KNT2_logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (November 2013)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;Taking place in the same world, but still not a remake or sequel to my all-time favorite Zelda game, A Link to the Past, this new entry in the Zelda series looks very promising. There aren't any specifics, but the spirit of the predecessor is clearly here - a Zelda game played in an overhead perspective with two linked worlds. I normally turn off the 3DS' stereoscopic 3D functionality, but the new vertical dungeon designs that will be enhanced by 3D might actually tempt me to turn it on. A new game mechanic/ability allowing Link to turn into a 2D drawing on walls will also add some Paper Mario-esque goodness to puzzles. This game will have everything going for it to satiate my long-held desire for a classic Zelda in the style of A Link to the Past!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; id=&quot;bravely&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-16/BDFF_Logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bravely Default: Flying Fairy boxart&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Bravely Default: Flying Fairy (~2014)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;My heart cries when amazing games are released only in Japan, and it looked like Square Enix's Bravely Default was going to go this route. An awesome JRPG featuring turn-based battles and a job system akin to Final Fantasy V's, Bravely Default sold very well in Japan and received a 38/40 from legendary Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Calls and petition to localize the game eventually got through and the game is now slated for release in 2013 in Europe and 2014 in North America! It seems like the Final Fantasy series is not returning to the classic, old-school goodness of games like FFVI and FFIX, but Bravely Default looks like it might be able to fulfill those nostalgic desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alternating-image&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 30px;&quot; id=&quot;yoshi&quot;&gt;	
  	&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-16/yoshi_new_island.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yoshi's New Island&quot; /&gt; 
  	&lt;h4&gt;Yoshi's New Island (~2014)&lt;/h4&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;I clearly remember my first day of Sunday school, because my mom picked me up along with a Super Nintendo and Super Mario World. I also remember the day my cousin Brian and I demolished Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island in a single evening during a sleepover. After my college roommate Theo Beers got a Wii, it took me a weekend to play through Super Mario Galaxy. When I thought I had my fill of Mario platformers, New Super Mario Bros. 2 on the 3DS got me hooked again with its excellent level design and compelling goal of collecting one million coins. I expect and hope Yoshi's New Island continues to channel the light-hearted fun and addictive gameplay that have become hallmarks of Mario platformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the 3DS has awesome games coming soon that I am eagerly awaiting, the one game I am most excited for is not on the 3DS. Check back later this week to read about the game I crave more than all others!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>GG Korea!</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/10/gg-korea/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/10/gg-korea</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyong-haseyo! The Vorgom Trinity has returned from its ten day excursion to Korea! Ge, Spencer, and I had a great time in Korea and we really enjoyed the New Interfaces for Musical Expression Conference (NIME) that was hosted by members of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon. Our poster presentation for SoundCraft went smoothly (we didn’t lose our poster during the 5,600+ mile journey) and our performance of GG Music was well-received. Aside from the conference, we got to do some sight-seeing, watch some professional StarCraft, play plenty of StarCraft, and of course eat tons of amazing food. Here are some highlights with photos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-10/korea-gstl.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSTL Match&lt;/em&gt; - We arrived in time to catch a StarCraft 2 GSTL (Global StarCraft Team League) match between two professional eSports teams - MVP and NSHoSeo. The GSTL is a league in Korea composed of eight professional StarCraft 2 teams, professionally produced by GOM TV. There are even Korean and English commentators to provide in-depth analysis of matches! Teams send out players who play 1-versus-1 matches in a best of 7 format. Players who win get to keep playing and players who lose must be replaced by another team member. The losing team also picks the map for the next set so there is some strategy involved in who gets sent out against who. That said, the match between MVP and NSHoSeo was a quick one as Keen, from team MVP, all-killed NSHoSeo by taking out four players without dropping a single set! Spencer and I actually made a few appearances on the show holding up some cheerfuls (handwritten signs)! After the match was over, we even got to meet the MVP team, and the English casters - Khaldor and Wolf!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-10/korea-keynote.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Train to Daejeon and NIME Keynotes&lt;/em&gt; - The first segment of the NIME conference was hosted at KAIST in Daejeon which is about 90 miles (~144 kilometers) south of Seoul. On the Korea Train Express (KTX) high-speed train, which has a max speed of 190 mph (305 km/h), we got to Daejeon in no time. NIME featured two keynote speakers - the first by Bill Verplank, a human-computer interaction designer based out of Stanford University. During his keynote, titled Motors and Music, Dr. Verplank discussed the difference between handles and buttons which invited an interesting observation from an audience member about the difference between toilet handles/buttons around the world. Dr. Verplank took the seemingly odd observation in stride and went over how people interact with toilets, providing plenty of laughs for the audience. The second keynote featured Ajay Kapur, a Princeton alumnus, who currently teaches at the California Institute of the Arts and the New Zealand School of Music. Ajay’s talk focused on gharanas - a system in Hindustani music that links musicians by lineage or apprenticeship. Ajay, a sitar player himself, showed us how he fits into one of India’s sitar gharanas, and then took that traditionally Hindu system and applied it to the world of computer music. Ajay explored all the people that mentored, collaborated with, and influenced his work in robotic music, along with the graduate students he now mentors. From that network, he began building his own personal computer music gharana. Both keynotes were superb!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-10/korea-poster.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poster Session and Korea Bakeries&lt;/em&gt; - We presented our poster on SoundCraft during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nime2013.kaist.ac.kr/program/posters_demos/index.html#posters_02&quot;&gt;Tuesday afternoon session&lt;/a&gt;. The session went well - there was a good turnout, plenty of awesome posters and demos in the hall, and quite a few people came over to hear about our work sonifying StarCraft 2. I even got interviewed by a Korean news crew that was at the conference! More importantly, Tuesday was also the day I discovered how wonderful Korean bakeries are. KAIST has a Tous Les Jours (a Korean bakery franchise) on campus and I ate some of the most amazing baked goods ever! My favorite item was a soft, milk bread bun with cream filling in it! While there are a few Tous Les Jours in the USA, there are none in the Bay Area. Fortunately for us, however, there are Paris Baguettes (another Korean bakery franchise) in the South Bay. There are also likely plenty of amazing non-franchise bakeries in the Bay Area. If you know of any awesome places please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;tweet me&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-10/korea-bbq.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concert and Korea BBQ&lt;/em&gt; - On Wednesday we performed GG Music during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nime2013.kaist.ac.kr/program/concerts/index.html#evening_concert_03&quot;&gt;evening concert&lt;/a&gt;. While GG Music had already been performed at Stanford CCRMA’s Music and Games concert, Spencer and Ge did some more powering up of the GG in GG Music. The finished product sounded great in the concert hall over eight channels - CCRMA’s penchant for multi-channel audio (shared by the Princeton Laptop Orchestra and its original multi-channel hemispherical speaker) made the piece even better as much of the feedback mentioned how great the spatialization of sound was. After the concert we celebrated by going to eat at a Korean BBQ restaurant. While finding English-speakers in Seoul was not a frequent occurrence, most restaurants had English translations or at least photos of the items, but most places in Daejeon did not! But we managed just fine. I had Jieun, one of Ge’s graduate students who is Korean, translate a few fundamental words/phrases (e.g. beef, pork, rice, bring more food) in my notebook. Armed with these handy phrases, a rediscovering of the game charades, and a dash of optimism with lots of head nodding, we filled our stomachs with amazing Korean BBQ!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-10/korea-running.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running About in Daejeon&lt;/em&gt; - While in Daejeon, jet-lag had me up very early in the morning. Curiosity to explore the town mixed with a tinge of guilt from the gluttonous meals we were consuming had me running around town. Like Seoul is divided by the Han River (with 27 bridges to cross it!), Daejeon is divided by the Gap River. The cab ride from our hotel to KAIST crossed the Gap River and I saw there were a few walking paths along the river, so I figured that would be a good place to go to. The walking paths along the river proved to be quite scenic. To add to that, across from the bridge we normally crossed to get to KAIST, there was an awesome pedestrian bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-10/korea-pcbang.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Day of NIME in Seoul and PC Bang&lt;/em&gt; - The last day of NIME took place in Seoul at the Lock Museum. The evening concert was particularly incredible featuring a piece, Bodhisatva - a Korean/Indian digital mashup, with Ajay on his electronic sitar and Eun-il Kang on an electronic Haegeum - a traditional Korean string instrument, resembling a fiddle. To round out the show was an amazing performance by Ensemble Sinawi - taking their name from the traditional form of Korean music, sinawi. Here is there &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pages/%EC%95%99%EC%83%81%EB%B8%94-%EC%8B%9C%EB%82%98%EC%9C%84-Ensemble-Sinawi/140213766095783&quot;&gt;Facebook band page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl-zGmtaohw&quot;&gt;song performed by the group&lt;/a&gt;. The concert closed out a successful NIME 2013. Afterwards we headed to our hotel in Seoul and started exploring the area. We quickly found and settled in at Wiz PC, a PC bang. It’s an Internet café mixed with a gaming center mixed with instant ramen and energy drinks. Quite simply - a nerd lair! While League of Legends is the dominant game played at PC bangs, we played the one true game - StarCraft 2. Interestingly enough, there was a brave soul a few seats down from us playing Brood War, the expansion to the original StarCraft!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-06-10/korea-finals.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSL Finals&lt;/em&gt; - On Saturday, I was able to fulfill a dream of mine and attended a GSL (Global StarCraft League) final. The GSL is the world’s most competitive StarCraft tournament and this final featured two strong players - a Terran, STX SouL’s Innovation and a Zerg, Woongjin Stars’ Soulkey. Innovation was heavily favored to win the best-of-7 finals and at the end of the third game with Innovation up 3-0, it looked like our trip to the finals was going to be a short one. Disappointment quickly transformed into excitement as Soulkey fought his way back to tie the series at 3-3, and then it all came down to the final set. Soulkey went on to win the set and the match 4-3, pulling off the greatest comeback in StarCraft 2 history! To top off the amazing day, after the finals were over, I got to meet the preeminent StarCraft casters and heroes of mine, Tasteless and Artosis. They were both extremely friendly and were also in awe of Soulkey’s comeback. After the finals, we headed back to the hotel and quickly made our way over to the Wiz PC. Inspired by watching amazing StarCraft, we had to go play tons of StarCraft ourselves to top off our wonderful trip before our departure back home the following day!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Earth Conscious Workshop at Smule</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/07/recycling-at-smule/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/07/recycling-at-smule</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Smule, we organize a brown bag lunch/seminar every month to enrich and enhance our collective awesomeness. Sometimes we have team members share their unique talents and other times we have guests visit. Since October 2012 we have had a tea ceremony, a photoshop tutorial, a seminar on all things bicycles, a ukulele workshop (turns out I’m a terrible ukulele player), a juggling workshop, a professional cycling workshop led by Matt Johnson (President of the pro cycling team Garmin/Sharp) and an epic keyboard workshop with Jordan Rudess of the progressive metal band Dream Theater. This past Friday, we had an Earth Conscious Workshop led by Heidi from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recology.com/&quot;&gt;Recology&lt;/a&gt; who led an awesome presentation about the importance of recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 8px;&quot;&gt;Heidi gave us the low-down on everything recycling/composting/landfills and held a Q&amp;amp;A after her presentation. The amount of interesting information shared during her visit was mind-blowing. Here are some highlights I took away from the workshop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversion rate is a measure of how much material is diverted from landfill disposal to recycling/composting, expressed as a percentage of the material diverted from the landfill. It wasn’t surprising that &lt;em&gt;San Francisco boasts the highest diversion rate of major US cities - diverting roughly 80% of its waste&lt;/em&gt;, and on track to become a zero-waste city (i.e. 100% diversion rate) by 2020! Compared to NYC, another big city with a ridiculous real estate market, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/downloads/pdf/DSNY-reports/Monthly_by_Boro_District_2012-10.pdf&quot;&gt;this PDF&lt;/a&gt; shows the diversion rate in October 2012 was a meager 12.1%! By 2020, when San Francisco hopes to be a zero-waste city, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/html/resources/reports_rate_definitions.shtml#ll40-goals&quot;&gt;NYC hopes to hit a 25% diversion rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are no recycling standards so the exact specifics vary among cities, but the &lt;em&gt;general rule for recycling vs composting vs landfill&lt;/em&gt;: plastics, glass, metals (includes aluminum-based stuff like cans/foil) and paper go to recycling; food and anything formerly living go to composting; and the rest goes to the landfill. If you have something that is a mixture of different materials, like a can of Pringles (paper on the outside, metal lining on the inside) or a packaging envelope from Amazon (paper on the outside, plastic bubble wrap on the inside), these need to be thrown in the waste bin because separating out the components is too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although items made of multiple materials are not recyclable, what about something like paper lined with plastic wax that you normally get at a deli? The general rule of thumb for recycling paper is the &lt;em&gt;rip test - if you can rip a paper item easily and no plastic film is visible along the tear, it can be composted!&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Smule, we have disposable utensils that are made from plants and biodegradable. One would think that this means it should go in the compost bin since it was made from formerly living things - plants. Unfortunately, made from plants and biodegradable can mean only a percentage of the utensil is actually made from plants/biodegradable, which means that these utensils can actually not be composted. Even worse, since they may be a combination of living material and plastic, recycling them is also not recommended (mixture of different materials) so these &lt;em&gt;seemingly environmentally-friendly biodegradable utensils need to go in the landfill bin&lt;/em&gt;! Only utensils marked as compostable are actually compostable!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “formerly living” description for items that should be composted invited questions about dead pets…and dead bodies. During the compost process, compostable material is heated to temperatures high enough to destroy any pathogens, but Heidi recommended you just &lt;em&gt;throw dead pets in the waste bin&lt;/em&gt; with no comment on dead bodies, so we assume that means they are compostable! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When recycling plastics, most people look for the triangular chasing arrow symbol. This triangle contains a number in the center that ranges from 1 to 7, but in San Francisco, you can ignore the number and just &lt;em&gt;recycle all rigid plastics&lt;/em&gt;. Rigid plastics are plastic items that can maintain their form. For example, a container with your takeout food might be a bit flimsy but it will hopefully not break its form when you press on it, whereas a non-rigid plastic bag or saran wrap changes its form easily under pressure. Non-rigid plastics that are mistakenly recycled can actually cause issues at recycling plants! &lt;em&gt;Non-rigid plastics cause jams in the machinery sorting recycled materials&lt;/em&gt; causing the entire processing line to be shut down, requiring manually removing the offending items! For items like plastic bags, you should reuse them locally instead of just throwing them into the landfill bin. Try reusing them when going grocery shopping or use them to collect pet waste. Some grocery stores also collect plastic bags and bundle them up for separate recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paper and plastic items are recycled in the same containers in San Francisco (single-stream recycling). &lt;em&gt;Plastic containers that are dirty should be recycled, but items should as clean as possible&lt;/em&gt; because if organic matter gets on paper, mold can form and that &lt;em&gt;mold breaks down the fibers in paper reducing the quality of the paper being recycled&lt;/em&gt;! There is a little paper recycling tip that does help here - &lt;em&gt;paper items that are not very thick like napkins and paper plates don’t need to be recycled&lt;/em&gt; because the fibers in these items are already so thin. Given paper comes from a living thing and what is on your plate or napkin is also compostable, you can conveniently just put these items in a compost bin!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If dirty plastic containers can ruin recycled paper, &lt;em&gt;why doesn’t San Francisco ditch single-stream recycling&lt;/em&gt; - where all recyclable items are put in one container by residents and sorted at recycling facilities - and just go for multi-stream recycling where items are sorted by residents? Recology tried this, but found that &lt;em&gt;less people were recycling because of the increased effort required for multi-stream recycling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone really enjoyed Heidi’s presentation and the impact of her visit was seen immediately. As we packed up for the weekend, marketing extraordinaire Turner Kirk snapped this photo and noted our recycling bin was overflowing, the compost bin was nearly full, and there was very little in the landfill bin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;An empty landfill bin is a happy landfill bin!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next in our workshop series is a beer-tasting workshop led by our very own beer connoisseurs Ryan and Nick! Check out Smule on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smule&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Smule&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for more awesomeness.

   <title>Tips for Android JSON Parsing Using Jackson</title>
   <link href="/2013/05/26/tips-for-android-json-parsing-using-jackson/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/05/26/tips-for-android-json-parsing-using-jackson</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Smule, we use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome&quot;&gt;Jackson library&lt;/a&gt; for our JSON parsing. Marshaling JSON into corresponding model objects is elegant and easy with Jackson and makes code much more readable. Here are some tips for those considering using Jackson for their marshaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; This post applies to Jackson 1.9. If you’re using Jackson 2.0, please see &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/07/07/upgrading-to-jackson-20/&quot;&gt;my post on upgrading from Jackson 1.9 to 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To parse JSON, you can &lt;strong&gt;use Jackson’s treeToValue method&lt;/strong&gt;. This method throws some exceptions so it’s &lt;strong&gt;recommended you create a helper method that catches these exceptions instead of having try-catches everywhere&lt;/strong&gt; you are parsing (our JSON helpers are in a class called JsonUtils). &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonBestPracticesPerformance&quot;&gt;Jackson best practices&lt;/a&gt; recommends one &lt;strong&gt;re-use object mappers since creation of the mapper is an expensive operation&lt;/strong&gt; - so our JSON helper class has a defaultMapper() method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// newsFeedItemJsonNode is a JsonNode containing the JSON to be parsed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// the second parameter specifies the class of the object you want back&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;parseJson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newsFeedItemJsonNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NewsFeedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this helper method can be used to make JSON parsing a one-line operation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;parseJson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;defaultMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;treeToValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TAG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Failed to parse JSON entity &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;getSimpleName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// re-use a single ObjectMapper so we're not creating multiple object mappers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;defaultMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sObjectMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model classes should usually &lt;strong&gt;ignore unknown JSON properties&lt;/strong&gt;. If a server API later adds new fields or we just don’t care about some fields, the parser won’t throw exceptions if they are ignored. Jackson also &lt;strong&gt;requires a defined default constructor&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise an exception will be thrown on parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// if ignoreUnknown is false, Jackson would throw an exception if we don't parse all fields&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@JsonIgnoreProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ignoreUnknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;NewsFeedItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;NewsFeedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Jackson requires a default constructor&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model classes can &lt;strong&gt;annotate variables to automatically parse JSON fields&lt;/strong&gt;. This works automatically for primitive types and Strings, but it &lt;strong&gt;can even parse other classes&lt;/strong&gt; if those classes are set up for Jackson parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;NewsFeedItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// will parse &quot;type&quot; out of our JSON and store it in the type variable&lt;/span&gt;
	 &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@JsonProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	 &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// FeedIcon is one of our classes set up to parse JSON&lt;/span&gt;
	 &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// here we parse a list of FeedIcon objects that are referenced by &quot;feedIcons&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	 &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@JsonProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;feedIcons&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FeedIcon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feedIcons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have data nested in an array or hash and want to get at the data in it, you have to &lt;strong&gt;override the setter Jackson creates and get the data yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider this JSON that has some data we’d like to store as two integers instead of a hash in our mode class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;social&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;numFollowers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;numFollowees&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extract the two integers out of “social” and store them as integers in our class, we override how Jackson parses the “social” JSON element:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// nested JSON - &quot;social&quot; contains two properties we'd like to store as integers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// override how Jackson parses &quot;social&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@JsonProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;social&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numFollowees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setSocial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socialJsonMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numFollowers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socialJsonMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;numFollowers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numFollowees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socialJsonMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;numFollowees&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overriding the setter is also useful if you have &lt;strong&gt;data you want to change at the time of parsing&lt;/strong&gt; because sometimes an API doesn’t give it to you like you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// override how we parse/set &quot;time&quot; so we can get the value in the desired format&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@JsonProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;time&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;timeValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;valueOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;timeValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;longValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overriding setters requires you to properly identify the JSON structure referenced by the key&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, when we overrode how “time” was parsed above, our setTime method took a String because in our JSON, the “time” key contained a string. Up higher, when parsing “social” our setSocial method took a map because “social” contained a map. Things can get even fancier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// &quot;performances&quot; is used to determine the number of performances a user has in each Smule app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@JsonProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;performances&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setPerformances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numPerformancesByAppList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;      
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;appPerformanceCountMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numPerformancesByAppList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do stuff!&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, “performances” in the JSON is an array of hashes. Note that the parameter you specify for the argument to your overriden set method must be relevant - if “performances” actually contained a hash of hashes, this method would not be called! &lt;strong&gt;If you specify the type of the argument as JsonNode, you will always get called&lt;/strong&gt;. In the above snippet if we specified the argument as type JsonNode, you would get called with an ArrayNode containing ObjectNodes that contain HashMaps. If you’re not sure what you are going to get back, start with JsonNode and work from there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of &lt;strong&gt;overriding a setter to parse an array of a custom model object that is nested within our JSON&lt;/strong&gt;. Here is some sample JSON containing some user information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;subjects&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;total&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;accountIcons&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;accountId&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;123456&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;handle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;SmuleUser&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;accountId&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;654321&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;handle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;SmuleSinger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to parse the “accountIcons” array, we override how “subjects” is set and parse out the AccountIcons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// we want to grab &quot;accountIcons&quot; in &quot;subjects&quot; so override how we process subjects&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// &quot;accountIcons&quot; contains  AccountIcon objects so Jackson will automatically parse those&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@JsonProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;subjects&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AccountIcon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setSubjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjectsJsonNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountIconsNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjectsJsonNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;accountIcons&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subjects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JsonUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;defaultMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accountIconsNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TypeReference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AccountIcon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for the setSubjects method we specify the argument as a JsonNode since the readValue() method requires a JsonNode. If we wanted to manually parse the data, we could change the type of subjectsJsonNode to be a Map&amp;lt;String, Object&amp;gt;. We could grab the Object with key “accountIcons,” cast it to a List&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;&amp;gt;, and then iterate over and parse the items as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps anyone considering considering or having problems using Jackson for their JSON parsing. If there is something totally awesome I missed about Jackson or did something not quite right here, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll update this post!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>SoundCraft Operational!</title>
   <link href="/2013/05/12/soundcraft-operational/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/05/12/soundcraft-operational</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited to announce that a recent project, SoundCraft, has made its way into the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference! SoundCraft combines a bunch of my favorite things: hanging out with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spencersalazar.com&quot;&gt;Spencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ge/&quot;&gt;Ge&lt;/a&gt; who are co-authors of the project, playing StarCraft 2, writing code, making music, and playing with new languages/systems. SoundCraft enables real-time data gathering from a StarCraft 2 game, allowing for a novel interpretation of the game. Or, as I’ve been telling people - we’re making music while playing StarCraft! Our paper, &lt;em&gt;SoundCraft: Transducing StarCraft 2&lt;/em&gt; is going to be published in the conference proceedings and our proposal for a performance using SoundCraft, titled &lt;em&gt;GG Music&lt;/em&gt;, was also accepted! In a most fitting way, the conference is being held in the Mecca of eSports, South Korea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-05-12/soundcraft-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the reviewers stated, &quot;both players/performers be bald for better projections.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for SoundCraft originated on StarCraft 2 day at Smule in July 2012, during a chat with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alltom.com&quot;&gt;Tom Lieber&lt;/a&gt; about potentially interesting computer music projects for NIME. After some quick research on the StarCraft custom map editor, I had a map writing out the amount of minerals and gas per second for each player to an XML file. I asked Tom how he’d parse an XML file, so it should come as no shock that the XML parser is written in Ruby. With the Nokogiri gem, parsing XML was painless and with the Open Sound Control (OSC) gem, data was ready to be received by your favorite OSC-compatible language. With a ChucK patch - featuring a saw wave and pulse oscillator with frequencies mapped to a player’s mineral and vespene amounts - a proof of concept for the system was completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Aside from the strong urge to play StarCraft while working on a StarCraft-based project, the most difficult part of the project was creating the custom map, the biggest unknown in the entire loop. The programmer in me would have loved to just get an API, and while the map-making community seems to have pieced together Blizzard's API and found a way to load code into a map, documentation was pretty sparse. Fortunately, I was able to procure a lot of help from the map-making community over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sc2mapster.com&quot;&gt;SC2 Mapster&lt;/a&gt; forums, including clutch support from Ryan Schutter whose GameHeart custom maps are used by huge tournaments like the GSL Team League and DreamHack! After plenty of pain, googling, and tweaks, we had a custom map that was writing out a ridiculous amount of information including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player’s race (i.e. Terran, Protoss, or Zerg)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Composition of the standing army and units lost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units and structures being produced and their current build progress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various metrics about economic health (e.g. mineral and vespene gas collection rate, harvesters built/lost)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total number of enemy units destroyed and enemy structures razed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-05-12/soundcraft-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spencer working on his strong Terran macro!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12px;&quot;&gt;Spencer took the lead on creating &lt;em&gt;GG Music&lt;/em&gt;, the first live performance piece powered by SoundCraft. The map was Bel'shir Vestige, I played Protoss, Spencer played Terran, and Ge was the observer who would direct what the audience sees while we played. The world premiere of &lt;em&gt;GG Music&lt;/em&gt; was at CCRMA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccrma.stanford.edu/events/music-and-games&quot;&gt;Music and Games Concert&lt;/a&gt; in late April. Aside from a little meta-technical difficulty with the Blizzard Updater update getting stuck, the performance went off without a hitch! Here is a video of the performance, recorded and edited by CCRMA's David Kerr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WisMhY5BWa4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;The three main gameplay elements sonified here are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workers returning resources trigger pings generated via FM synthesis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unit composition - Protoss units produce rhythmic/percussive sounds; Terran units produce uniformly rhythmic/melodic/arpeggiated sounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dying units create a jarring ping generated by passing an impulse through a low-pass which envelopes a harsh high-pitched sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to head to NIME to present SoundCraft, give another performance of &lt;em&gt;GG Music&lt;/em&gt;, rendezvous with our computer music friends, eat a lot of good food, go to some professional StarCraft tournaments (we are going to the GSL finals!), and of course play more StarCraft!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markcerqueira/soundCraft&quot;&gt;source code for SoundCraft and GG Music on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d like any more information on SoundCraft, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt;! GG!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Managing Multiple Android SDKs/NDKs in Jenkins</title>
   <link href="/2013/05/08/managing-multiple-android-sdksndks-and-jenkins/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/05/08/managing-multiple-android-sdksndks-and-jenkins</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Smule, we use a single node to run Jenkins for our Android projects. When building our projects that rely on both the SDK and NDK tools, we defined SDK_DIR and NDK_DIR as global environmental variables. But what happens when the tools are updated? In 2012, Google released &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/tools-notes.html&quot;&gt;5 major updates&lt;/a&gt; to its Android SDK tools and &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html#Revisions&quot;&gt;6 revisions&lt;/a&gt; to its NDK toolset. Synchronizing a single team to upgrade is relatively straightforward. But when coordinating different teams that may be in different phases of a release cycle, a smooth transition is oftentimes difficult to achieve. Furthermore, if we upgrade the tools and later need to build an older tag, we are not recreating the build as it truly was, since the tools are now upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve these problems, we moved the configuration of the SDK and NDK path from the global Jenkins configuration environment and put it somewhere where it could be project-independent and version controlled. Each project now contains a bash file that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Available NDK Paths&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;NDK_8B_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/Jenkins/android-ndk-r8b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;NDK_8D_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/Jenkins/android-ndk-r8d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Available SDK Paths&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;SDK_16_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/Jenkins/android-sdk-16-macosx/tools&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;SDK_21_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/Jenkins/android-sdk-21-macosx/tools&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$NDK_8D_PATH&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$SDK_21_PATH&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$SDK_21_PATH&lt;/span&gt;/platform-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires some bookkeeping to maintain various versions of the SDK and NDK toolsets on a single machine or across multiple nodes for multi-node setups. Now, a team can select the SDK and NDK they want whenever they are ready and with zero impact on any other teams while still preserving the ability to accurately create older builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;The basic Jenkins workflow for our Android jobs now looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out the project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute the script within the project that exports our desired NDK and SDK paths. This step gives us flexibility and helps us recreate older builds/tags accurately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute the script that writes out the SDK/NDK paths to required places (e.g. local.properties).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any extra configuration you need to do before you build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discard any changes made to files. If on the next pull we update the SDK/NDK paths, we will want to make sure any file changes are gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post-build archiving/publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Staving Rampant Copy-and-Paste in Jenkins with Templates</title>
   <link href="/2013/05/03/jenkins-and-templates/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/05/03/jenkins-and-templates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Smule, we use Jenkins build servers for our iOS and Android projects. Along the way, we have learned a lot and continue to learn and improve our build system.Changing anything in Jenkins could be viewed as a double-edged sword. Awesome changes make things better, but when you have (in our case) tens or more jobs per project for different combinations of branches/environments/configurations, applying these changes involves a lot of copy-and-paste. The standard Jenkins installation does not provide any serious power in helping to abstract out shared logic into reusable chunks that have fewer points of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;templates-to-the-rescue&quot;&gt;Templates to the Rescue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudBees has created the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-features-templates-plugin.cb&quot;&gt;Templates Plugin&lt;/a&gt;. But to use it, you need to pay CloudBees to access their entire suite of enterprise plugins. Others have explored and are developing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco-abstracts.cb#MartinSchroder&quot;&gt;inheritance-based approach&lt;/a&gt;, but the plugin is not available yet. At Smule we use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Template+Project+Plugin&quot;&gt;Template Project Plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Best of all, it is free, open, actively maintained, and works! Just for our Android build system, we went from maintaining nearly one hundred jobs (by copying-and-pasting any changes we made to jobs) to maintaining only a handful — and this covers two separate projects with multiple branches and environments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;template-project-plugin-in-action&quot;&gt;Template Project Plugin in Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the template plugin, you create a job that will have modules - source code management (SCM), builders, publishers - that will be used by other projects. Here is the SCM for the template project, &lt;em&gt;sing-build-template&lt;/em&gt;, for all Sing Android builds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-05-03/SCM-build-template.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;SCM module of the Sing Android template job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the template plugin, we had to copy the repository URL and branch into every job. Now, jobs can use the SCM module of the &lt;em&gt;sing-build-template&lt;/em&gt; job:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-05-03/SCM-using-template.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;SCM module of a regular Sing Android job using the SCM from the template job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template plugin also allows jobs using modules from other jobs to pass configuration to the template job via environmental variables. In the above example, you can see that the branch that is being checked out is denoted by the value of the &lt;em&gt;BRANCH&lt;/em&gt; environmental variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;rounded-corners&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2013-05-03/SCM-defining-environmental.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A Sing Android job configuring which branch it would like to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This basic example shows how easy it is to consolidate shared functionality into a single location that can be reused. If we migrated away from GitHub as our hosting service, updating all our jobs would be much easier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system does not completely remove the need for copy-and-paste as modules that are being used still need to be configured for every new job. An inheritance-based system would allow children jobs to inherit all functionality from its parent and override only what’s necessary. That said, with the Template Project plugin our Jenkins servers have become much easier to maintain and improve upon!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ant, dex, and jars all over</title>
   <link href="/2013/05/01/ant-dex-and-jars-all-over/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/05/01/ant-dex-and-jars-all-over</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently added &lt;a href=&quot;http://androidannotations.org/&quot;&gt;Android Annotations&lt;/a&gt; to the Sing Karaoke Android project. Using the annotations has been awesome so far, but it did present an interesting issue when it came to compiling and bundling the proper library in our Ant build script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android Annotations provides two jar files: &lt;em&gt;androidannotations-X.Y.jar&lt;/em&gt; used to generate code at compile time and &lt;em&gt;androidannotations-X.Y-api.jar&lt;/em&gt; which contains only the code necessary during run time. So for our builds, in addition to the standard &lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt; folder used for compilation/runtime, we would compile with a &lt;strong&gt;libs-compiling&lt;/strong&gt; folder containing &lt;em&gt;androidannotations-X.Y.jar&lt;/em&gt; and then link with a &lt;strong&gt;libs-runtime&lt;/strong&gt; folder containing &lt;em&gt;androidannotations-X.Y-api.jar&lt;/em&gt;. I deviated a bit from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations/wiki/Building-Project-Ant&quot;&gt;recommended setup&lt;/a&gt; for where to put these libraries because I wanted the folders containing the libraries to all be treated the same during the Ant build process. The end goal here is:
* &lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt; - used during compile time and runtime
* &lt;strong&gt;libs-compiling&lt;/strong&gt; - used only during compile time
* &lt;strong&gt;libs-runtime&lt;/strong&gt; - used only during runtime&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the compile step, in the javac task we can use the handy classpath attribute to add any extra libraries we need to make the compiler happy (&lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;libs-compiling&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml-cheetah&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml+cheetah&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- include all libraries needed for compilation --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;fileset dir=&quot;libs&quot; includes=&quot;*.jar&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;fileset dir=&quot;libs-compiling&quot; includes=&quot;*.jar&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, compilation will succeed. But afterwards, when everything is compiled into a Dalvik Executable (.dex) and packaged into a single .apk file, only the jars in the &lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt; folder were getting pulled. So the app would load, but would crash as soon as it tries to use any of the methods in the missing jar libraries. This did not come as much of a shock; the classpath attribute’s scope likely terminates as soon as javac is done. After beating my head against a wall trying to get dex to acknowledge my &lt;strong&gt;libs-runtime&lt;/strong&gt; folder, I implemented this &lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# run this command before we execute our Ant build&lt;/span&gt;
cp -R -v libs-compiling/ libs/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml-cheetah&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml+cheetah&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- TODO fix dex step so we can do this properly --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- include all libraries needed for compilation --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- &amp;lt;fileset dir=&quot;libs-compiling&quot; includes=&quot;*.jar&quot;/&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;fileset dir=&quot;libs&quot; includes=&quot;*.jar&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me cringe a little inside, especially since we were using the bulkier compile version of Android Annotations and not the slimmer runtime version. Fortunately, I got around to taking care of this as well. At first, I searched the internet and could not find anything that would just let me specify some extra paths for dex. A few solutions had people running the dx command themselves, but after a few failed attempts at copy-and-paste-and-adapt, I started looking elsewhere. Eventually, I just started looking at the default Ant build.xml file that is distributed in the tools folder of the Android SDK. In there was this Ant macro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml-cheetah&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml+cheetah&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Configurable macro, which allows to pass as parameters output directory,
     output dex filename and external libraries to dex (optional) --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;macrodef name=&quot;dex-helper&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hit when I googled “dex-helper” for some usage tips is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13091&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; which was fortunately closed in January 2011, but did include an awesome example. So at the end of this adventure, I arrived at a painless solution to the issue of dex running when there are jar files in multiple directories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml-cheetah&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml+cheetah&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;target name=&quot;-post-compile&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;echo message=&quot;Adding external libs to dex lib path via dex-helper&quot;/&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;dex-helper&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;external-libs&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;fileset dir=&quot;libs-runtime&quot; includes=&quot;*.jar&quot;/&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- no need to add &quot;libs&quot; as dex already adds it --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/external-libs&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/dex-helper&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we compile with &lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;libs-compiling&lt;/strong&gt; and run with &lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;libs-runtime&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
