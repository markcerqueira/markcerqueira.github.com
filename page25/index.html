        Tale of Two Xiaolongbao

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>My quest to sample the entire frozen foods section of the Chinese super market continues. I picked up two bags of Shanghai Soup Dumplings (xiaolongbao) the other day. On the left is Mini Soupy Buns by Prime Food, and on the right is Pork Mini Buns (Crab Meat Added) by Wei-Chuan. What happens next NEEDS to be shared.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Two dumplings vie for a special place in my heart...</strong></p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p>Into the steamer they go! So far, they look pretty much the same.</p>

<div>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Prime Food (right) and Wei-Chuan (left)</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Twenty minutes later, I have some steamed dumplings waiting for me. The Prime Food dumplings look a biter paler than the Wei-Chuan ones, but if they both taste great, I won’t complain.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-03-04/cooked.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Prime Food (right) and Wei-Chuan (left)</strong></p>
</div>

<p>But they don’t taste the same. The <strong>Prime Food dumplings are TERRIBLE</strong>. So terrible, I spat out my first bite and dropped the rest into the trash. The meat tasted over-processed and the dumpling skin was… gooey. On the other hand, the <strong>Wei-Chuan dumplings were GREAT</strong> – so great that I still can’t believe they came from a bag out of my freezer. These bad boys are packed with delicious meat and broth. Who would’ve thought these two would be so different?</p>

<p>To the little crab guy on the Prime Food bag that looks really happy, screw you for being such a DECEIVER. There isn’t ANY happiness in this bag.</p>

        Frozen Pork Bun Face-Off
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>In July of 2013, some friends and I went on a <a href="/2013/07/04/bbq-pork-bun-crawl---san-francisco/">BBQ Pork Bun crawl in SF</a>. It was great because I was able to indulge my addiction to pork buns while at the same time offering reviews of several pork bun establishments – for the public good, of course. Very recently, I have discovered the frozen foods section at a local Chinese grocery store, which stocks a ton of frozen pork buns. I grabbed every package of bun, took them home, and stuffed them in my freezer. Instead of crawling the foggy city, I crawled my freezer in search of the best pork buns in the bunch. Off we go!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-03-02/contenders.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The contenders enter the arena!</strong></p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p>Eight different types (7 steamed, 1 baked) of pork buns were purchased from Marina Foods in San Mateo. Between all the buns, two companies were represented: Myriad Foods (2 buns) and Prime Foods (6 buns). Each bun was judged on a scale of 1 (bad) to 3 (great) in two different categories: taste of the meat, and taste of the bread. Note that personal preference plays a large role when it comes to judging a pork bun because there is no single ideal way to make a pork bun. For example, some people prefer their meat sweeter, while others enjoy their buns more savory. We both tasted each of the eight buns and talked through our feelings, arriving at the following results:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<table style="margin-bottom: 1em; min-width: 700px;">
<tr><th align="left">Bun</th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meat Quality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bread Quality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#000000">Myriad Cha Siu BBQ Pork Buns</font></td><td style="text-align: center">2</td><td style="text-align: center">2</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#000000">Myriad Pork and Vegetable Buns</font></td><td style="text-align: center">2</td><td style="text-align: center">2</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#ff0000">Prime Food Steamed Pork Bun (Hang Zhou Style)</font></td><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: center">2</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#006600">Prime Food Steam Buns with Roasted Pork Buns</font></td><td style="text-align: center">3</td><td style="text-align: center">1</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#ff0000">Prime Food Leek and Pork Bun</font></td><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: center">1</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#006600">Prime Food Steam Roasted Pork Bun with Oyster Flavor Sauce</font></td><td style="text-align: center">3</td><td style="text-align: center">3</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#ff0000">Prime Food Pork and Cabbage Bun with Oyster Flavor Sauce</font></td><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: center">2</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="#000000">Prime Food Roasted Pork Bun (Baked)</font></td><td style="text-align: center">2</td><td style="text-align: center">2</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>The results can generally fall into three groups: buns we enjoyed (green), buns we won’t be buying again (red), and the buns in between – good, but not great (black). Even though the bread isn’t anything to brag about, the <strong>Prime Food Steam Buns with Roasted Pork Buns</strong> were my favorites because of the sweet-flavored meat inside. Only one bun got a perfect score: the <strong>Prime Food Steam Roasted Pork Bun with Oyster Flavor Sauce</strong>. Even though the meat inside is savory, it’s still a good bun. The three buns that got tagged in red contained meat that tasted totally off – I mean, was it even meat?! Don’t want to know. That said, they still might be right up your alley given how different people’s tastes are when it comes to pork buns. The three buns in black just aren’t good enough to take up the valuable real estate in my freezer.</p>

<p>I’m glad (and scared) that I have such easy access to a wonderful selection of pork buns in my freezer. They may not be fresh out of the oven, but there are some pretty great buns to be had without ever having to leave the comfort of your home. It’s true when they say, “Home is where the delicious pork buns are.”</p>

    <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2014</span>

    <p>I finished playing Bravely Default earlier this week. I’ll write a longer post about it but here’s the tl;dr – it’s an amazing game. Up next on my playlist includes Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, MGS 5, and Final Fantasy X HD – all still unreleased. With a “free” weekend, I took the time to check out various titles I’ve been thinking about playing. Here’s a whirlwind tour of the games I checked out this weekend as a valiant <strong>Weekend Video Game Warrior</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-02-24/weapon_shop.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Weapon Shop de Omasse (3DS)</strong> - A very humorous and lighthearted twist on the JRPG genre. In this game, the Evil Lord is returning and brave adventurers are setting out to take him down. But you’re not going anywhere because you need to run a weapon shop in Starting City. You rent weapons to your patrons, which forces you to care about whether they survive their quests. You’ll spend most of your time forging weapons (rhythm game) and polishing weapons (rubbing the screen until the weapon is shiny). There is plenty of self-deprecating humor, both when you meet NPCs and heroes who visit your shop and via the Twitter-esque live feed called the Grindcast. I’m very glad Level 5 finally got around to releasing the last piece of the Guild01 series in the US because its a fun, quirky, and addictive experience.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Valkyria Chronicles 3 (PSP)</strong> - This game was never actually released (and never will be) in the US because Sega sucks. But a bunch of enterprising fans created a fan translation for this game. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my favorite games on the PS3. Valkyria Chronicles 2 (VC2) on the PSP was good too. Like its predecessor, Valkyria Chronicles 3 (VC3) is more of the same, but that’s not a bad thing at all. Chronologically, VC3 takes place during the same time as the original. Instead of being part of the regular army, this time you are part of a penal military squad that is given the most dangerous missions. Like previous entries, battles are grand and some are quite challenging. To everyone at the Valkyria Chronicles 3 Translation Project, thank you for letting English-speakers play this gem!</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Persona 4 Arena (PS3)</strong> - Persona 5 is scheduled for a 2014 Winter release on the PS3 in Japan. I’m hoping for a worldwide release, but I’m unsure that will happen. After having such a great time playing Persona 4 Golden (Vita), I’m craving more and more Persona. Instead of diving into Persona 3 which could easily become a 100+ hour investment, I decided to revisit Inaba in the form of a fighting game: Persona 4 Arena (P4A). A collaboration between the team behind Persona (Atlus) and the team behind Guilty Gear and BlazBlue (Arc System Works), P4A delivers a story-driven sequel to Persona 4 with arcade-style fights mixed throughout. I don’t like fighting games much, so I’m planning to watch a Let’s Play series of it so I can get the story and skip the fighting.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>StarCraft 2 (Mac/PC)</strong> - StarCraft 2 has become part of my daily routine that I oftentimes forget I’m playing a video game. Dubbed “The One True Game” by Ge Wang, I can never get enough StarCraft. I’m not “intense” enough to play 1v1, so unless I’m playing the campaign, I’m always playing with friends. StarCraft is the game that never gets boring; each game is unique and with three different races, the match-ups, possibilities, and outcomes are endless. If you haven’t played StarCraft yet, the Starter Edition lets you play all Arcade games for free. It’s worth checking out! GG!</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (Wii U)</strong> - Man, I really want to like this game. It’s ridiculously beautiful and the original Donkey Kong Country games on the SNES are some of my all-time favorite games. But, like Donkey Kong Country Returns (Wii, 3DS), I find the controls are too sluggish and complicated. To me, the game is challenging because the controls are hard to grasp, not because the game is inherently challenging. Perhaps the Wii U GamePad is the issue, so I’ll try again with the older-school Pro Controller. Honestly, I think expecting the tight handling from the original SNES games might have been my undoing.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>SteamWorld Dig (3DS)</strong> - Sometimes the craziest ideas make the best games. In SteamWorld Dig, you are a robot that inherits a mine from your uncle. You arrive at the mine and from there you dig, dig, dig, and dig some more. As you carve into the mine, you’ll find puzzles to solve and minerals to sell, which lets you upgrade yourself (the perk of being a robot). The controls are super tight (especially welcome after my disappointing experience with Donkey Kong Country), and the game ropes you into an addictive loop of explore, gather, and upgrade. I think I’ll stop writing here, so I can get back to digging!</p>

        Let's Not Talk About How Awesome PS Plus Is

  	<p>I recently read a head-to-head review of the Xbox One and PS4 in the Personal Tech section of the NY Times.<sup>1</sup> The review pegs the PS4 as the better of the two consoles, but questions if powerful home consoles are even relevant anymore. That flame-war-inspiring question aside, I find the most interesting thing about the review is something that has been repeatedly glossed over by a lot of people (even Sony): how awesome PlayStation Plus is.</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p>First, let’s look back at the previous iterations of these juggernauts. The Xbox 360 required an Xbox Live Gold membership if you wanted to play online or use online streaming services (e.g. Netflix). If you were on a PS3, you could enjoy online multiplayer and streaming services for free. The Xbox One inherited the 360’s fee-based access to both multiplayer and streaming services as the reviewer points out:</p>

<blockquote>
"[On the Xbox One, to] access streaming media, apps or even the channel guide, you must pay for a $60-per-year Xbox Live Gold account, on top of your Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime or any other service subscription fee."
</blockquote>

<p>To many people’s disappointment, the PS4 is not <strong>100% free</strong> like its predecessor. While you won’t need to pay for access to streaming services on the PS4, you will need to have PlayStation Plus (the equivalent of Xbox Live Gold) if you want to play online multiplayer:</p>

<blockquote>
"And unlike the Xbox, [on the PS4] access to streaming services is free. You do need a $50-per-year PlayStation Plus account if you want to play online with other gamers."
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of people say “Sony went the route of Microsoft when it came to online access for the PS4,” but that isn’t quite right. Because there is one AWESOME thing about PS Plus that doesn’t get talked about enough: the <strong>Instant Game Collection</strong> (IGC). The IGC is a collection of <strong>FREE</strong> downloadable games for the PS3, PS4, and Vita. Games are added every month, and some are rotated out, but games you claim can be downloaded so long as you remain a PS Plus member. Yes, it sucks that you need to pay to get access to online multiplayer. But would you feel better if you had access to a ton of free games? It makes me feel REAL good.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 900px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-02-16/ps_plus_games.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The Instant Game Collection &mdash; February 2014</strong></p>
</div>

<p>These aren’t crappy games either – the current IGC includes heavy hitters like Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands 2, Uncharted 3, and Resogun. Even if you don’t have a PS4 (like me), PS Plus seems like a no-brainer. In just its first year, PS Plus gave free access to games valued at over $1,800!<sup>2</sup> PS Plus members get discounts on games too.</p>

<p>So yes – you do need to pay $50 to access online multiplayer, but you’re going to also get access to a ton of awesome games as well. So when I see people talking about PS Plus and just ignoring this treasure trove, a piece of me dies. For frugal gamers or people who are just curious about certain games, PS Plus is a ridiculous value proposition. If you keep your eyes peeled around Black Friday, you can even buy a year’s worth of PS Plus for only $30. Call the cops because I feel like I’m robbing someone blind!</p>

        Three Things About Ys: Memories of Celceta
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2014</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" style="border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-02-04/ys-cover.jpg" alt="Ys: Memories of Celceta" /> 
  	<p>I was a bit hesitant when I bought a Vita. Compared to the 3DS, most other consoles' game libraries are pathetic. Being in the handheld space, and with such a meager library, no one looked worse than the Vita. Yet, my hesitation is slowly being assuaged as the Vita game library gains some really awesome games. <strong>Ys: Memories of Celceta</strong> is a welcome addition to the Vita lineup, especially for fans of action RPGs. I plowed through this game and enjoyed it very much. I actually played it so much in one session that my Vita ran out of battery! Exploring the large forest of Celceta, duking it out with baddies, powering up my equipment, and of course &mdash; saving the world &mdash; was a total blast. Instead of waxing poetic about how great this game is, I'd like to discuss three things that stuck out to me while playing.</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Oddly enough, <strong>saving your game was weird</strong>! Ys can be played exclusively with the physical controls (i.e. buttons, joysticks). Navigating menus and certain actions could be completed using the touch screen, but I found myself always sticking to the physical controls. However, there was one place where touch controls were the only way to proceed: saving your game. So in essence, you’re playing a game that can be played exclusively using physical controls, but when you go to save your game, the controls no longer do anything! Obviously a minor user experience hiccup, but a hiccup nonetheless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a positive note, Ys <strong>addressed the issue of excessive back-tracking</strong>. In Ys, you are tasked with exploring the large, mysterious forest of Celceta. Fortunately, there is a system of fast-travel. As you explore the world, you discover monuments of different colors. When you touch a monument, you can fast travel to other monuments of the same color. For example, the starting town has orange monuments, the outside area has yellow monuments, and the forest has light blue monuments. But because you are restricted to fast-travel within one color, you still need to slow-travel between monuments of different colors. It’s usually fine, but the more colors you get, the more tedious it becomes. I was hoping that at some point, all monuments would lose their color attribute, but <strong>Ys one-upped me</strong>. Halfway through the game, you get a special item called the Golden Wing. The Golden Wing lets you warp to any monument from absolutely anywhere (no need to touch a monument to warp). Just when using the existing fast-travel system was beginning to feel tedious, the system becames even faster and more convenient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And then there was <strong>the forging system that could’ve used some quality-of-life improvements</strong>. In Ys, you can reinforce your weapons and armor with materials to give them bonus attributes. For example, your weapon could potentially inflict poison, or your armor could develop resistance to paralysis. It’s possible to efficiently max out all these attributes by following a recipe. The recipe looks something like this: take a weapon and reinforce it with 8 Sturdy Shells, 8 Strong Hairs, 4 Titanic Bones, and 2 Amethyst. Sweet! That’s 5 reinforce operations, right? Nope! The game <strong>does not allow you to fuse multiple items at a time</strong>. For the aforementioned recipe, you are not performing 5 operations, but 22! If the game allowed multiple items to be reinforced at once, you could create the ultimate weapon with 15 operations. Instead, you’ll actually be performing 56… And you’ll need to keep track of how many of each item you’ve reinforced already, which I screwed up a few times!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Don't get the wrong idea - this game is awesome.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Even though two of my three observations are somewhat negative, don’t let my post mislead you: <strong>this game is really great</strong> and I highly recommend it. If the Vita continues to get games where my only complaints are about user experience inconsistencies and quality-of-life improvements, I see a bright future ahead`` for the Vita.</p>
