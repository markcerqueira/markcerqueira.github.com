        Kicking the Tires with PayPal
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>This week, Apple announced that Touch ID APIs would be available for use by third party developers. These new APIs allow developers to use the fingerprint identity sensor to authenticate users. Curiously enough, Paypal has come forward to inform us that their developers attended a session on integrating Touch ID into their app. A source at Paypal is quoted saying, “It seems to be a fairly easy API to use, but we’re still kicking the tires” in a Business Insider article.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Kicking the tires? Before you start questioning the quality of this new API or even contemplating integration, why don’t you reflect on the current state of your iOS app? I have two-factor authentication enabled on my PayPal account. After all, I don’t want ONLY a password to be between a bad person and my bank account. But guess what happens when I try to log into PayPal on my iPhone.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>This is pathetic.png.</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Are you kidding me?</strong> I actually need to choose between having two-factor authentication or having access to PayPal on my mobile device. Why would a company, which deals with a person’s finances, put their customers in this kind of position? Why would they implement a security feature, but not support it across all platforms? Why don’t you “kick the tire” on your existing subpar (very generous by the way) app before you even start contemplating adding the bells and whistles of Touch ID?</p>

        Say Hello to the New Sing! on Android
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 May 2014</span>

    <p>Greetings <em>Sing! Karaoke</em> Android people! This is Mark, Engineer-Progenitor of Smule’s <em>Sing!</em> Android app. Since we first released our debut version of Sing! Android in December 2012, over 4 million of you have played with our app. Today, we’re proud to announce that we haven’t, in fact, been sitting on our thumbs for the past few months. The entire team here at Smule HQ has been hard at work making <em>Sing!</em> for Android even better. To find out how we’ve improved <em>Sing!</em>, read on.</p>

<div>

<p><em>Note:</em> This post is featured on the Smule blog. Visit <a href="http://blog.smule.com">blog.smule.com</a> to learn more about what’s going on at Smule.</p>

<p>Here at Smule, we believe change is good. That’s why we’ve given Sing! for Android a major facelift — designed to make it easier for you to get around, explore and discover new ways to Sing! For example, the previous version of the app used a tab bar on the bottom of the screen for navigation. Now, there is a navigation drawer, which also has other things for you to explore, like hot Open Mic performances and recent performances by your friends. Browsing performances has also become a lot more streamlined. Now, when you select a performance, a little bar slides up from the bottom and starts playing it, allowing you to continue browsing other performances.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-05-28/browsing.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>A more streamlined performance-browsing experience.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>The core singing experience has also gotten a makeover to make it more streamlined. Long gone are the days when you needed to wait for your performance to render whenever you adjusted voice volume, changed effects, or updated delay calibration. Now, everything will automatically re-render at the current playback location and resume playback. And just like NASA, Smule has also abandoned our space shuttle – the little one that indicates your pitch level – and replaced it with a simpler triangle because the astronauts in our space shuttle missed their family.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The core singing experience gets a design update and lots of optimizations.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Major re-designs are always challenging. Engineers need to find new ways to introduce bugs. Testers try to break things. And project managers wring their hands over deadlines. It’s a crazy time for everyone, but we think you’ll like what we came up with: a new and beautiful <em>Sing! Karaoke</em> for Android. We hope you enjoy it. Sing on!</p>

        The Bay Area Soft-Serve Epidemic
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>

    <p>Bay Area, we have a problem. You have all types of amazing food. Everything seems to be covered. But when I want amazing <strong>soft-serve ice cream</strong>, you know where I go? <strong>McDonald’s</strong>. Yes - you heard right! There are plenty of froyo places, and plenty of hard-serve ice cream places, but there are not enough places to <strong>SATISFY MY ADDICTION TO SOFT-SERVE</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-05-14/smule-train.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The Smule Soft-Serve Train at McDonald's. All aboard!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Here are the Bay Area locations I know of that make soft-serve:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bi-Rite Creamery</strong> - Dishes out some pretty good soft-serve, with a nice selection of flavors that changes everyday. But they don’t really take soft-serve seriously. They have two locations, yet only serve soft-serve at one. And the soft-serve window has shorter hours than the regular ice cream. Talk about DISRESPECT!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Super Duper</strong> - You can get decent burgers, shakes, and soft-serve here. They have Vanilla and Chocolate flavors, the soft-serve is made with Strauss Organic Milk, and they can dip your cone in chocolate. Yet, friends and I agree that the soft-serve just isn’t amazing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fast Food (McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, Wienerschnitzel)</strong> - When it comes to availability, nothing beats fast food. Fast food joints everywhere offer soft-serve. Some soft-serve aficionado colleagues of mine did some taste tests, and we agree – McDonald’s is the King of Fast Soft-Serve. It’s not organic, and it might be made by mixing some dairy-esque powder and water, but their soft-serve is legit.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You see how <strong>SHORT</strong> this list is? It’s <strong>PATHETIC</strong>! It’s an <strong>EPIDEMIC</strong> and lovers of soft-serve are suffering dearly!</p>

<div>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>An addict enjoying a waffle cone with some delicious Vanilla Soft-Serve in NJ!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Point of comparison? I’m visiting my parents, who live in the lush, green suburbs of New Jersey. There are TWO soft-serve places near us that both dish out creamy, flavorful goodness. One of them even has waffle cones, chocolate-dipped waffle cones, and RAINBOW SPRINKLES. Bay Area – you know stuff’s bad when I can’t even find a place to sprinkle some rainbow on my soft-serve. But no one worry: I’m a problem-solver. Once I’ve had my fill of this programming stuff, I’m buying a soft-serve ice cream truck!</p>

        The Final Fantasy X|X-2 Remaster is Amazing
      </a>

  	<p><strong>I rarely replay games.</strong> My video game backlog is huge, and I've come to terms that some games just aren't going to get played until I retire to my parent's basement and live out the remaining days of my life as a quiet, video-game-pounding nerd. Even with the weight of a massive backlog on my shoulders, replaying Final Fantasy X and X-2 has been a wonderful experience. A lot of love was put into this remaster. Square Enix didn't just bump the polygon count, slap HD on the cover art, and ship it. This is a <strong>true remaster</strong>, including a remastered soundtrack for FFX that I really enjoyed given my passion for video game music.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>People knock both games.</strong> FFX is hated for the childish and whiney Tidus. The awkward laughing scene is ALWAYS brought up when people make fun of FFX, yet it isn’t awkward at all if properly contextualized. Yet despite all these supposed flaws, FFX tells a wonderful and heartbreaking story, with amazing gameplay to back it up. FFX-2 gets knocked for being too much like Charlie’s Angels set in the Final Fantasy universe. Yet, the game takes many brave departures from the prequel and executes well across the board. Following Yuna as she struggles to come to terms with the loss of Tidus, in a world she radically changed with his help, and the hope that she may find him again makes for an interesting story.</p>

<p>If you like JRPGs and never played FFX or FFX-2, go get a copy of the remaster now! Playing both the PS3 and PS Vita version, I found myself playing on the Vita a lot more. Yes, the PS3 version looks a bit nicer, but the Vita version actually looks great. There is cross-save functionality so you can switch between the two if you want to play on both platforms. Some would think I would regret spending valuable video-game-playing-time revisiting Spira, but <strong>I have ZERO regrets about replaying both of these gems.</strong></p>

    <p>It’s hard to believe today marks a year since my first blog post. I originally started blogging to improve and refine my writing chops, and to rant about things like work, video games, food, and fitness. It’s been a busy year, with a whopping <strong>54 blog posts</strong> (one per week!). Some months were very busy (10 posts in July), while others were likely filled with extreme video gaming (only one post in November). Here’s to another year filled with interesting experiences and waxing on poetic about them!</p>
