  	<p>Glatering was developed during the first Evernote Hackathon. Glatering lets Evernoters give their opinions on caterers. Glatering won Honorable Mention for being the most honorable project. It is currently deployed internationally in the Evernote offices in Redwood City, Austin, and Zurich. Once developed, Glatering simultaneously signed a huge contract with Evernote, went public, and was acquired by Salesforce for sixty billion dollars.</p>

  	<h3>SoundCraft: Transducing StarCraft 2</h3>

  	<p>SoundCraft is a framework that enables real-time data gathering from a StarCraft 2 game to external software applications, allowing for musical interpretation of the gameâ€™s internal structure and strategies in novel ways. The paper detailing the technical and aesthetic development of SoundCraft was published in the Proceedings of the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) Conference 2013.</p>

  	<h3>GG Music</h3>

  	<span>live performance: <a href="http://youtu.be/WisMhY5BWa4">http://youtu.be/WisMhY5BWa4/</a></span>
  	<p>In GG Music, SoundCraft's first performance piece, two players go head-to-head in a competitive match of StarCraft 2, observed by a third performer.  As they develop economies and wage battles against each other, SoundCraft collects gameplay data, which is extensively sonified in real-time. The sonification rises and falls with the development of the ongoing match, exploring the relationship between StarCraft's gameplay mechanics and musical performance. GG Music premiered at the Music and Games concert at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) and was selected to be a performed at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) Conference 2013 in Daejeon, South Korea.</p>

  	<h3>Laptop Orchestra Network Toolkit (LOrkNeT)</h3>

  	<span>Mark Cerqueira, Dan Trueman (2010)</span>
  	<span><a href="http://lorknet.cs.princeton.edu/">http://lorknet.cs.princeton.edu/</a></span>
  	<p>My senior thesis project, advised by <a href="http://www.manyarrowsmusic.com/">Dan Trueman</a>, involved developing a toolkit that would help assess network conditions (e.g. latency, jitter) affecting synchronization in laptop orchestra performances. LOrkNeT was used to identify and help remedy issues affecting the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk). Work on less network-dependent synchronization via local NTP was also explored.</p>

  	<p>This composition created for the Electronic Computer Composition course explores the soundscape of an afternoon on Princeton University's campus. Armed with a Zoom H2n recorder, sounds were gathered from locations around campus including skateboarders and walkers near Prospect house, the printer at Woolworth Library, and giggling girl performed by Mia Tsui. Collected sounds were mixed using Pro Tools.</p>
