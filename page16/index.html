        Context is Live in Evernote for Android!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Dec 2014</span>

    <p>It’s been a little over a month since I joined Team Android at Evernote. I’m happy to announce that I’ve been busy along with the rest of the team bringing you an update to our Android app. Among many other things, <strong>Evernote for Android now supports Context!</strong></p>

<div>
	<img style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-12-18/context_nexus.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>What is Context? Say you’re procrastinating at work browsing the Washington Post, and you run into an article about Japan recently beating out Scotland for top scotch of the year. Take that Scotland! You use the <a href="https://evernote.com/webclipper/">Evernote Web Clipper</a> to save it to your ever-growing notebook of articles you promise you’ll read one day.</p>

<p>Months later, you finally get around to reading that article. You reach the end and normally that’d be the end. But with Context, you’ll find articles and notes related to the one you just finished reading. Context pulls content from sources like The Wall Street Journal, your own notes, and even your LinkedIn contacts.</p>

<p>I’m biased, but I think it’s pretty cool. The “classical model of intelligence” is based around how much you can remember without any tools to assist you. But today people have extremely powerful and more importantly - extremely connected - devices in their pockets. I think the “modern model of intelligence” assesses how quickly we are able to access the information we need. Evernote remembers everything for us, so we’re covered there pretty well. Now, Context helps us find related information that can further augment our knowledge and increase our productivity. That is, unless spending an afternoon reading about scotch is not your definition of productive!</p>

        An Open Letter to the Lollipop Keyboard
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2014</span>

    <p>Dearest Lollipop Keyboard,</p>

<p>This is most upsetting. I upgraded my Nexus 7 to Android Lollipop and quickly regretted it after using you for the first time. <strong>Fatigued</strong> is the best word to describe how I felt. Why would I feel fatigued!?</p>

<p>Just take a look at yourself.</p>

<div>
	<img style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-12-10/lollipop.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>What have you become!?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>The freaking lines separating your keys are gone.</strong> Along with the characters themselves, the lines helped my finger hit its target. Yes, I do type with just one finger. They’re gone. I typed a little more and my fears were confirmed; I was exerting myself more than usual.</p>

<p>Seriously. You were an amazing keyboard and then Google came along and lathered “Material Design” all over you. I’m sick of the excess use of bright white, I’m sick of thin grey fonts on white backgrounds, I’m sick of everything going flat, and I’m sick of labeling all this under some holier-than-thou Material Design umbrella and expecting everyone to be excited about it.</p>

<p>Sincerely disgruntled,</p>

<p>Mark</p>

        Thoughts on Serial

  	<p>After hearing about this podcast that was blowing up the charts, I finally checked out <strong>Serial</strong>. Serial follows the 1999 Baltimore murder of a high school girl, Hae Min Lee. Her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was charged and found guilty of the murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime. While there was scant physical evidence incriminating Anand, the prosecution had a star witness: Adnan's friend Jay, who said he helped bury the body of Lee after Adnan murdered her. 
	</p>
</div>

<p>Directed and narrated by Sarah Koenig, each week we walk alongside Koenig as she explores every facet of this story.</p>

<p>I started listening on Monday. On Tuesday, I had blown thrown 10 episodes – that’s <strong>7 hours of content in two days</strong>! It’s good. It gets you hooked. They did a pretty stand-up job producing this show. While I eagerly wait for my next fix of Serial (delivered on Thursdays), I put some of my thoughts about the show on paper.</p>

<!--break-->

<ul>
  <li>Regarding <strong>who I think committed the murder</strong>: I don’t know. There just isn’t enough hard evidence to point in any direction. It could be Adnan. It could be Jay. It could be someone we have no idea about.</li>
  <li>The <strong>influence of race</strong> is too understated. America is far from post-racial today and it wasn’t any better in 1999. Here we have a Pakistani guy being accused by a black man of killing a Korean girl, in a courtroom with a predominantly black jury. Koenig touches on this only briefly. I can see why she doesn’t want her show to blandly conclude “just blame it on race,” but race could explain a lot of why things went down the way they did.</li>
  <li>How good must it feel to be that marketing person at <strong>MailChimp</strong> that set up the sponsorship of Serial? #MailKimp</li>
  <li>Adnan is going before the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to argue that his lawyer did not effectively represent him during the trial. The judiciary should be objective, but I wonder if the <strong>clout of Serial will have any sway</strong> – even if minimal – on their thought process and decision.</li>
  <li>Will <strong>Serial inspire clones</strong> where people investigate crimes of supposed false imprisonment? What effect will this have on people who claim they are falsely imprisoned, and will these people start being more vocal about their story in the hopes that someone picks it up?</li>
  <li>Will <strong>Redditors (the majority of who think Adnan is innocent) riot</strong> if Adnan doesn’t win his appeal in January?</li>
  <li>The <strong>criminal justice system is total crap</strong>. It sounds like if Adnan admitted to the murder and showed remorse, he might’ve gotten a lighter sentence. So if he actually didn’t do it, he could admit he did to try to get a reduced sentence. He stuck to his guns hoping the jury would not decide he was guilty, and now he’ll spend the rest of his life in jail.</li>
  <li><strong>If I was falsely imprisoned I’d be super pissed</strong> and I’d let people know it, especially if someone came to me and asked me to spill my guts out. But I don’t know what fifteen years in prison would do to someone. Adnan might’ve resigned himself long ago to the fact that he will probably never leave the prison system.</li>
  <li>There are <strong>only two episodes left in season one</strong>. Serial got funding for another season, but it’ll be a while before that comes out. What will I do without Serial!?</li>
  <li>If <strong>NPR held Serial hostage during its pledge drives</strong>, could they be massively shortened!? Just imagine: “if we can reach a trillion dollars in donations in one week, we’ll release Serial twice a week year-round!”</li>
</ul>

<p>Haven’t checked out Serial yet? Set some time aside and <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/">do it now!</a></p>

        Finish the Flow!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Nov 2014</span>

    <p>The other day I got a follower on Instagram. Yay! But, I think this follower was a scammer. Any time someone on the internet invites you to visit a website to get to know them better, it’s usually a scam. Especially when their name is MissDiamond. Bummer!</p>

<p>Like any good community member, I decided to report this user. Here’s what the “reporting a user on Instagram” user flow looks like.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-11-18/instagram.gif" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>See that last screen where Instagram thanks me for reporting this user? I sat on that screen for a while. Little did I know I had to <strong>press “Cancel” in the top left to dismiss the confirmation</strong>. That’s pretty bad. I just completed doing something. Don’t make me doubt myself by forcing me to hit a button that says “Cancel.” Put a button that says “OK” or something more positive! <strong>Finish the flow, please!</strong></p>

        My Weekend with Tales of Hearts R

    <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2014</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-11-16/tohr.jpg" alt="Tales of Hearts R" /> 
  	<p>I picked up <strong>Tales of Hearts R</strong> this week. Originally released in Japan in 2008 on the Nintendo DS, six years later a re-imagining of the original made its way to the PlayStation Vita in the West. As the weekend comes to a close, I unabashedly admit that I poured twelve hours into this game! I'm a fan of the Tales series so I'm a little biased and I have yet to finish the game, but this game is great so far. Here are some thoughts:</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>A lot of reviews about this game give the <strong>localization</strong> a lot of flak. My command of Japanese is pretty poor, but I haven’t run into anything that’s offensively translated yet. They did “translate” the protagonist’s name from Shing to Kor, which I think is pretty weird, given they left other Japanese names like Kohaku and Hisui as is.</li>
  <li>The <strong>story</strong> is somewhat cheesy, but I like it. The theme in this game, as the title hints at rather strongly, is about love and “meetings between hearts.” So far, there is enough mystery in the plot and characters that I want to keep playing to see what comes out of the woodwork.</li>
  <li>The <strong>battle system</strong> is what you’d expect of a Tales game: lots of action and a lot of fun. The AI for the characters you don’t control is pretty smart too; I can count on one hand the times I questioned what my allies were doing!</li>
  <li>The <strong>growth system</strong> is cool. Characters gain EXP from slaying fiends and as they level up, they gain points to improve their stats. Points can be allocated over six categories that improve different groups of stats. Spend enough points in a category and it will level up, granting new skills. Leveling up categories uniformly is encouraged as bonuses are awarded when adjacent categories reach certain levels. All in all, the system makes me want to level up more and more so I can improve my characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyhow, time to squeeze in a few more hours with Tales of Hearts R before I go to bed! :)</p>
