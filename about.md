I am an Engineering Manager at [Twitch][7]. 
Twitch is where millions of people come together live every day to chat, interact, and make their own entertainment together. 
I lead a team of talented Android and iOS developers to deliver a delightful Twitch experience on mobile. 

In the land before management, I was an Android Engineer at Twitch.
Before that, I was an Android (and sometimes iOS) Engineer at [Evernote][6] -- making a productivity tool used and loved by millions even better. 
And before Evernote I was a Mobile Engineer at [Smule][5], where I split my time between Android and iOS development. 
<!-- I also led Smule's world-class food and culture program. -->

I am an active member of the [San Francisco Kendo Dojo][1] and [Stanford Kendo Club][2]. <!-- , and currently hold the rank of Kendo 1 Kyu. -->
I am an avid StarCraft 2 player (Protoss). 
I enjoy playing video games and listening to video game music. 
I am partial to JRPGs: my favorite series include the Valkyrie Profile, Nier, Grandia, Tales, Persona, Trails of Cold Steel, and Xenoblade series. 
My favorite video game composers are Yasunori Mitsuda and Keiichi Okabe.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Princeton University, along with a certificate in Portuguese and Spanish Languages and Cultures. 
My senior thesis, advised by [Dan Trueman][3], was titled *Synchronization over Networks for Live Laptop Music Performance*, and resulted in the creation of [LOrkNeT][4].
