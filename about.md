I am a Senior Director of Engineering at [Pinterest][8].
Pinterest is the visual inspiration platform where people come to search, save, and shop the best ideas in the world for all of lifeâ€™s moments.
I lead a talented group that builds the foundation for all Android, iOS, Web, API, and Design Systems development at Pinterest.

Prior to Pinterest, I led Android and iOS product development and platform teams at [Twitch][7].
Before that, I was an Android (and sometimes iOS) Engineer at [Evernote][6] -- making a productivity tool used and loved by millions even better.
And before Evernote I was a Mobile Engineer at [Smule][5], where I split my time between Android and iOS development.
<!-- I also led Smule's world-class food and culture program. -->

I am an avid StarCraft 2 player (Protoss). My favorite units are Photon Cannons and Carriers.
I enjoy reading, playing video games, running, rucking, weight-lifting, and listening to video game music.
<!-- I was formerly an active member of the [San Francisco Kendo Dojo][1] and [Stanford Kendo Club][2] but taking a break now to focus on being a good dad. --> <!-- , and currently hold the rank of Kendo 1 Kyu. -->
I am partial to JRPGs: my favorite games include Valkyrie Profile, Final Fantasy X, Expedition 33, NieR: Automata, Grandia II, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Star Ocean: The Second Story, Tales of Symphonia, Terranigma, and every single Xenoblade game.
My favorite video game composers are Yasunori Mitsuda, Yoko Shimomura, Keiichi Okabe, and Lorien Testard.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Princeton University, along with a certificate in Portuguese and Spanish Languages and Cultures.
My senior thesis, advised by [Dan Trueman][3], was titled *Synchronization over Networks for Live Laptop Music Performance*, and resulted in the creation of [LOrkNeT][4].
