I am an Android developer at [Evernote][6] -- making a product used and loved by millions even better on the Android platform. Besides writing code, I run with The Herd, Evernote's running club. I'm also an up-and-coming superstar barista: making and serving coffee from Evernote's espresso bar.

Before Evernote, I was a developer at [Smule][5], a mobile app startup focused on building social music experiences, from August 2010 to August 2014. I did both iOS development (Magic Piano, I Am T-Pain, Ocarina, Magic Fiddle) and Android development (Sing Karaoke, Magic Piano). I also oversaw Smule's world-class food and culture program. Under my command, program highlights included StarCraft 2 Day, an official company holiday where people come to work just to eat and play StarCraft; and Smule Thanksgiving, which featured three oversize turduckens.

I am an active member of the [San Francisco Kendo Dojo][1] and [Stanford Kendo Club][2], and currently hold the rank of Kendo 1 Kyu. I am an avid StarCraft 2 player (Protoss). I enjoy playing video games and listening to video game music. I am partial to JRPGs: my favorite series include the Valkyrie Profile, Grandia, Tales, and Xeno series. My favorite video game composer is Yasunori Mitsuda. Check out the Chrono Cross or Chrono Trigger soundtrack for some truly magical stuff!

I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Princeton University, along with a certificate in Portuguese and Spanish Languages and Cultures. My senior thesis, advised by [Dan Trueman][3], was titled *Synchronization over Networks for Live Laptop Music Performance*, and resulted in the creation of [LOrkNeT][4].
