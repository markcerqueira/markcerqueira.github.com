I am an Android developer at [Twitch][7]. Twitch is the world's leading social video platform and community for gamers, video game culture, and the creative arts. I aim to make the memes danker and the overall Twitch experience on Android top-notch. 

Before Twitch, I was an Android (with a side of iOS) developer at [Evernote][6] -- making a productivity tool used and loved by millions even better. And before Evernote, I was a mobile developer at [Smule][5]. Smule focuses on building social music experiences and I split my time between iOS and Android development. I also oversaw Smule's world-class food and culture program.

I am an active member of the [San Francisco Kendo Dojo][1] and [Stanford Kendo Club][2], and currently hold the rank of Kendo 1 Kyu. I am an avid StarCraft 2 player (Protoss). I enjoy playing video games and listening to video game music. I am partial to JRPGs: my favorite series include the Valkyrie Profile, Grandia, Tales, Persona, and Xenoblade series. My favorite video game composer is Yasunori Mitsuda. Check out the Chrono Cross or Chrono Trigger soundtrack for some truly magical stuff!

I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Princeton University, along with a certificate in Portuguese and Spanish Languages and Cultures. My senior thesis, advised by [Dan Trueman][3], was titled *Synchronization over Networks for Live Laptop Music Performance*, and resulted in the creation of [LOrkNeT][4].
