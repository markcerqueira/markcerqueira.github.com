**SoundCraft** is a framework that enables real-time data gathering from a StarCraft 2 game to external software applications, allowing for musical interpretation of the gameâ€™s internal structure and strategies in novel ways. SoundCraft was created with the StarCraft 2 Map Editor, Ruby, and the ChucK audio programming language. The paper detailing the technical and aesthetic development of SoundCraft was published in the Proceedings of the [New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) Conference 2013][1].

**GG Music** examines the possibilities of using StarCraft 2 as the interface to a rich musical environment. In GG Music, two players go head-to-head in a competitive match of StarCraft 2, observed by a third performer. As they develop economies and wage battles against each other, SoundCraft collects gameplay data, which is extensively sonified in real-time. The sonification rises and falls with the development of the ongoing match, exploring the relationship between StarCraft's gameplay mechanics and musical performance. 

GG Music was performed at the [Music and Gaming Concert][2], Stanford, CA, April 2013 and at the 2013 Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression in Daejeon, Korea ([performance proposal][3]).
