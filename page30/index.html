        Mission Accomplished
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>I did some running leading up to the Spartan Beast in early August, and while I’m no junky for runner’s high, I ended up really enjoying that portion of my training. Following the Spartan, I kept running, and as August came to a close, I decided to give myself a challenge: <strong>run 100 miles in September</strong>. Previously, my longest distance covered in a month was about 70 miles, so the goal here was to increase distance. Armed with a playlist of Final Fantasy battle music, I can trick myself into doing anything. Well, October’s here already, so this is how it went.</p>

<!--break-->

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>September's Running Log</b></p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">I use MapMyRun to track my runs. It lets me know how far I've run, how fast, and maintains a history of all my workouts. Tracking my runs fulfills a nerdy sense of satisfaction. Here are some stats for September:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Total distance</strong>: 100.24 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Number of runs</strong>: 18</li>
  <li><strong>Average distance per run</strong>: 5.56 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Average pace</strong>: 9:05 minutes per mile</li>
  <li><strong>Longest run</strong>: 13.17 miles (half marathon, baby!) on 9/2</li>
  <li><strong>Calories burned</strong>: ~12,800 calories</li>
</ul>

<p>I barely made the mark, but I’m happy to say – <strong>mission accomplished</strong>! October’s goals are less concrete, but still involve running. I want to do runs where I focus on moving faster and keeping all my splits comfortably under 9 minutes. I also want to incorporate some high intensity interval training to work on building a more robust endurance. See you in a month, and happy training!</p>

    <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2013</span>

    <p>I <strong>used</strong> to be really fat. At my worst, I weighed 255 pounds and my doctor was telling me I should do something about my high cholesterol and high blood pressure – an indirect way of telling me I’m a fat ass. And then I did something about it. Today, I’ve lost a third of my former self, have the blood pressure of an athlete, and my doctor can finally stop looking for medical euphemisms for “fat ass.”</p>

</div>

<p>I don’t have some secret diet or exercise plan. I just started <strong>eating less, moving more, and lifting heavy things</strong>. Progress is slow and takes time; <strong>nothing magical will happen overnight</strong> or even over a month. Weight loss is a never-ending journey: I’ve reached my goals, but continue to remain vigilant about my health because I absolutely refuse to go back. For the first time ever I feel comfortable in my own skin, and I only want to get stronger. I’m challenging myself to run longer and faster, to improve my kendo, and to lift heavier. In short, <strong>it feels good</strong>, so I’m going to keep being healthy.</p>

        Initial Impression of Final Fantasy XIV
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2013</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/arr-logo.jpg" alt="A Realm Reborn" /> 
  	<p>After a botched release of its second massive multiplayer online RPG (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix shut down the game and went back to drawing board. Two years later, the development team has returned with a great game, appropriately titled A Realm Reborn. I never played the original version of FFXIV, but have played the latest version since its release. The first week was a little rough, given Square Enix's servers were having trouble handling all the traffic, but things are all good on that front now. After two weeks filled with exploring the world of Eorzea, I must admit I'm impressed...and hooked! </p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/ffxiv_locations.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>The world of Final Fantasy XIV<br />Clockwise from top-left: Ul'dah, Limsa Lominsa, Gridania, Eastern La Noscea</b></p>
</div>

<p>Like any Final Fantasy game, story plays a huge role in this game. There are cutscenes and mandatory story quests that must be completed to unlock additional content. And this isn’t some loose story that dissipates after a few hours; you’ll be going through story quests from level 1 to level 50. Depending on the class you choose, you’ll start in one of three major cities on the Eorzean continent: the verdant forest nation of Gridania, the ocean-side swashbuckling Limsa Lominsa, or the arid mining city of Ul’dah. A few hours in, you’ll have explored one of these cities in depth and visited the other two.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/garlean_empire.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>The leaders of the Garlean Empire.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Soon, you’ll learn about the antagonists of this tale. Interestingly enough, the shutdown of the failed original version plays a role in the story. The shut down is portrayed as The Calamity. The evil Garlean Empire (FFI reference to the antagonist Garland) makes a push to conquer Eorzea. Similar to Sephiroth casting Meteor in Final Fantasy VII, the Garleans cause one of Eorzea’s moons, Dalamud, to fall toward Eorzea. As Dalamud approaches, the primal Bahamut emerges from within the moon and devastates Eorzea. A Realm Reborn picks up five years after The Calamity, when your character must contest with the encroaching Garlean Empire, and the overwhelming threat of the primals (summons). The Garlean Empire is like the Gestahlian Empire in Final Fantasy VI: an advanced technological nation with Magitek seeking to conquer others for access to their resources. There will be plenty of the usual MMORPG filler: go kill this monster, go collect this item, and go deliver this package to some inconvenient location. But the story always seems to kick in when this filler starts to get tedious – hooking you right back in.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-09-04/ffxiv_classes.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Art for the Marauder, Alchemist, Botanist, Warrior, and Thaumaturge.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The class system is extremely flexible. There are 5 fighting classes, 3 magic classes, 8 crafting classes, and 3 gathering classes. All these classes are treated equally, and you switch between them by simply switching your weapon. For example, you can fight your way to a mineral node as an Archer, switch to a Miner to harvest resources, and then switch over to an Armorer to craft new equipment. To unlock jobs (specialized classes) you need to get a class to level 30 and another to level 15. I started off as a Lancer, hoping to eventually become a Dragoon, which requires a level 30 Lancer and level 15 Marauder. When I began leveling my Marauder, I found I enjoyed playing a tank class much more, so I stuck with Marauder to 30, got a Gladiator to 15, and now have unlocked the Warrior job. Switching classes is encouraged, easy, and most importantly doesn’t require creating new characters or losing progress. Aside from just checking out new classes for fun, you can learn abilities in those alternate classes that other classes can then use.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>A Lancer at work.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The gameplay itself is fun and approachable. Raiding dungeons is introduced in the story quests; these aren’t difficult, but do require that everyone on the team play their role properly. That said, Square Enix is catering to more hardcore MMORPG players by providing Hard mode versions of dungeons and boss fights, with even higher difficulties slated for future expansions. New mechanics (e.g. materia socketing, battling chocobo companions) are introduced roughly every 10 levels, so if you feel overwhelmed with the amount of stuff you can do at level 10, it’s only going to get worse (in a good way)! The battle system is standard, but enemies will sometimes telegraph attacks by projecting danger zones, giving you a chance to avoid the attack by getting out of the zone. In dungeons, there are even limit breaks – so if you’re a black mage, you can finish off an enemy with the Meteor spell! Crafting is surprisingly addictive: I find myself spending most of my time collecting resources and then crafting items to use, sell, and share with friends. Nobou Uematsu composed the soundtrack to the original version, and Masayoshi Soken took over for A Realm Reborn. I’m not sure how much material was borrowed from the original version, but this game has some really great music: some that pays tribute to the classics, some that are fresh, and others in between.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Your chocobo will get you places faster, and even fight with you!</b></p>
</div>

<p>There are still some rough edges to this comeback tale. The inventory management system is a bit unwieldy, but I could be facing the worst of it because I have been dabbling in all of the crafting and gathering classes. The Gear Set system, which easily allows you to manage different equipment sets for different classes is helpful, but could be more useful by telling you which items in your Armory Chest (a special equipment bag) is part of a set. Cleaning up my inventory and Armory Chest has taken up more time than I’d like to admit. The world is also currently inundated with spammers looking to sell gold, but Square Enix has a team dedicated to cleaning up all this noise. There is also a bit of lag and synchronization issues with the server, which results in you getting hit by a telegraphed enemy attack, even though you moved out of the danger zone in time. Square Enix is aware of many of the issues gamers have voiced, and has been very vocal about what they’re currently working on, so the future looks bright for this game.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>My character profile.<br />Note my penchant for gathering (Disciples of the Land) and crafting (Disciples of the Hand).</b></p>
</div>

<p>I currently just passed level 30 and unlocked the Warrior job. I’ve gone through the three introductory dungeons, as well as the next three in the story quest, fought a few primals, and am having a blast so far. I’ve spent a good amount of time gathering and crafting, which I find to be really interesting. My friends who are playing alongside me are also admittedly hooked, one going so far as to say “this game is like crack.” Square Enix plans to release major content updates quarterly so “game completion” will likely be an ephemeral state for most.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of checking out FFXIV, create a character on the <strong>Faerie</strong> server, and add <strong>Marcus Fierlaine</strong> so we can play together. Happy adventuring!

        Working at a Zoo
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>In high school, I was fortunate to be part of the Science Explorers Program at the Newark Museum. Founded in 1995, this program was part of the YouthAlive! national initiative, which aimed to “provide positive work and learning opportunities for young people.” During my three years in the program I got to participate in cool science workshops, field trips to national parks, a sightseeing tour of Washington DC, an annual fundraising gala, and even had my portrait painted by an artist. But most importantly, I got to spend three years working in a zoo! <strong>Warning</strong>: Pictures of me in high school, incoming!</p>

<!--break-->

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-20/zoo.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>Sights from the Newark Museum Mini Zoo.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The Mini Zoo at the Newark Museum featured over one hundred animals spanning roughly fifty different species. “Mini” is certainly warranted as we only had nine public-facing animal enclosures and did not feature any large animals: our largest resident was an 8-foot long, 60 pound Burmese Python called Bernie. We had a lot of animals behind-the-scenes that were used for educational programs at the museum. Some of my favorites at the zoo were Blanca, an Umbrella Cockatoo; Digger, a Fennec Fox; Ginny, a Virginia Opossum; and Dave, quite possibly the oldest Rock Dove Pigeon ever. The team of keepers managing the zoo was likewise pretty small: there were two full-time animal keepers, a part-time keeper, and me.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-20/blanca.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>Me and Blanca (Umbrella Cockatoo) at her birthday party.</b></p>
</div>

<p>I’m sure the ramp up program for a high school student with no experience handling or caring for animals involves a lot of vetting. During the school year I did one four-hour shift each weekend and my first few visits involved reading up on all the animals in the zoo, and common rules regarding care and handling animals. After that, I spent three months in the kitchen. A trusty binder covered, in very great depth, all the dishes I had to prepare. Growing up hating vegetables and greens, I got pretty good at differentiating them. I later found out that three months in the kitchen usually bored most aspiring animal keeper interns, who eventually would just transfer to a different part of the museum.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 350px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-20/ginny2.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>Me and Ginny (Virginia Opossum): the only friendly opossum I know!</b></p>
</div>

<p>Following that, the list of tasks I could be given slowly grew. After three months in the kitchen, I started carefully placing food in the animal habitats. Once, a mongoose must’ve thought my hand was food because he took a quick nibble at it! Then, I started cleaning the animal habitats, and that’s <strong>a lot</strong> of what animal keeping is about. It’s not about hanging out and giving animals food. It’s about making sure animals are in safe, clean environments, are eating their food, and regularly going to the bathroom. In short, there’s <strong>tons of looking for and cleaning poop</strong>, and poop is important because it says a lot about the health of an animal. There was also time for play and enrichment, to provide a stimulating environment and to enhance their general well-being. Still, sometimes animals would poop during play time. Eventually, I was doing everything the full-time keepers were doing – working full-time during my summers and having a blast along the way.</p>

	<p class="caption-text"><b>Ginny (Virginia Opossum) liked to poop a lot, but never pooped on me.</b></p>
</div>

<p>I miss my days at the Mini Zoo; when I started college, I dropped by the zoo every time I visited home to see my keeper friends and animal friends. I wish I could urge everyone to go visit the Mini Zoo, but unfortunately during the budget crisis in 2010, the Newark Museum decided to close down the zoo. It seems they gave the keepers only two days notice, and kept only one person to take care of and find new homes for the animals. I felt terrible for this person, as well as the animals: one person could <strong>never</strong> do everything required to properly care for them, without even considering the time it takes to find them new homes! I really am grateful to the museum for the wonderful experience I had during my time there. But the closing of the Mini Zoo – and particularly how that closing was handled – just stinks, and leaves a really bitter taste in my mouth.</p>

        Rapid Reviews
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>It’s been a busy month filled with work, kendo, eating, exercising, a Spartan race, and of course plenty of video gaming. The past month has been extremely generous with releases on both console and especially handheld platforms. So far, there has been a mix of hits and duds. Here are some rapid reviews of the games I have checked out over the past few weeks.</p>

<!--break-->

<div class="alternating-image" id="ProjectXZone">	
  	<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/ProjectXZone.jpg" alt="Project X-Zone box art" /> 
  	<h4>Project X-Zone (3DS)</h4>
  	<p>I'll admit, I was really excited for Project X-Zone. Come on -- how could a strategy RPG featuring characters from heavy-hitting Capcom and Namco series not be awesome? Two hours into X-Zone, I put it down. Although I gave the story barely any time to develop, the core of the game -- battling -- was just boring. I didn't feel like I had to plan out every move (like in Final Fantasy Tactics) to avoid getting wiped out. I was just moving my characters around the map, easily cleaning up the bad guys over and over again. While I'm glad quirky games like X-Zone are getting localized, this particular one really let me down.</p>
</div>

<div class="alternating-image" id="Shin Megami Tensei IV">	
  	<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/smt_4.jpg" alt="Shin Megami Tensei IV box art" /> 
  	<h4>Shin Megami Tensei IV (3DS)</h4>
  	<p>My JRPG portfolio is disappointingly lacking in games from Atlus's Shin Megami Tensei series. So I dove headfirst into SMT4, and found the experience to be simultaneously rewarding, enjoyable, frustrating, and depressing. The game is definitely challenging: I was punished for using the wrong elemental spell by getting massacred immediately afterward by "smirking" monsters. Towards the end of the game, I resorted to abusing the reflect damage spells to defeat powerful enemies. However, the gameplay was solid; I enjoyed exploring each area, recruiting and fusing monsters to build my personal army of henchmen. Regarding plot, SMT4 doesn't tell a happy story. Exploring post-apocalyptic Tokyo, you'll experience the worst humanity has to offer. Depending on your choices throughout the game, you'll get one of a few endings, all of which are sure to disappoint the optimists out there. That said, I highly encourage anyone looking for a solid JRPG to check this game out.</p>
</div>

<div class="alternating-image" id="Tales of Xillia">	
  	<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/xillia.jpg" alt="Tales of Xillia boxart" /> 
  	<h4>Tales of Xillia (PS3)</h4>
  	<p>Twenty hours in, Xillia is looking to be another solid entry in the Tales series. In Xillia, you get to choose between two main characters: a fisticuff-wielding honors medical student called Jude Mathis, or the Lord of Spirits in sword-toting human form, Milla Maxwell. When the main characters are together, you'll experience the same story, but when the characters split up, you experience the story from the perspective of your character. The opening hour of the game aside, the characters have spent most of their time together, so I don't see myself replaying the game to get the other character's perspective. The new additions to the already solid Tales gameplay are refreshing. The Lilium Orb resembles Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid, and allows customization when powering up characters. Materials collected while exploring are used to expand shops, which then unlocks more powerful items. The already solid action-oriented Tales battle system now has Linking, which allows two characters to link up for all sorts of benefits. The story so far appears to be your standard JRPG story where some evil person has a super powerful weapon and you're tasked with destroying it. All the main characters are interesting, and I'm curious to learn more about them. I'm not even done with Xillia, but am already excited for the stateside release of its sequel in 2014!</p>
</div>

<div class="alternating-image" id="Dragon's Crown">	
  	<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/dragonscrown.jpg" alt="Dragon's Crown boxart" /> 
  	<h4>Dragon's Crown (Vita)</h4>
  	<p>From Vanillaware, the creators of Muramasa, I saw Dragon's Crown as a spiritual successor to Muramasa. I found improvements, but sadly, along with disappointments. Addressing Muramasa's hearty dose of backtracking, Dragon's Crown features a central hub town, and then a gate that allows players to fast travel to the different dungeons they explore. While this is awesome, the gameplay just doesn't feel as polished or smooth as Muramasa. Moving my character around feels clunky. Having to hold down a button to run, which is incidentally also the button to attack, seems dumb to me. Being able to recruit three NPCs or friends to play with you sounds good in theory, especially since monsters in dungeons are too powerful to be conquered alone. That said, with three other characters on the screen, I keep losing track of my character during the busy battles. With other strong offerings on handheld devices, Dragon's Crown has moved into the "paused" game backlog.</p>
</div>

<div class="alternating-image" id="Mario &amp; Luigi Dream Team">	
  	<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-08-15/dreamteam.jpg" alt="Mario &amp; Luigi Dream Team boxart" /> 
  	<h4>Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team (3DS)</h4>
  	<p>I've avoided checking out the Mario &amp; Luigi series because I felt that it just wouldn't compare to its spiritual predecessor -- Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars -- which is one of my favorite games. That said, I decided to give Dream Team a try. Three days later, I'm six hours in and loving every minute of it. The story is light, funny, and of course features Peach getting kidnapped early on. Mixing platformer and RPG elements, the gameplay is fun and engaging. The battle system is turn-based, but involves a lot of action when it comes to getting critical hits and dodging enemy attacks. The game holds your hand a bit too much early on, but the tutorials fortunately taper off as you get through the opening chapter of the game. While it's similar yet different from Super Mario RPG, I'll admit I've made a mistake ignoring the Mario &amp; Luigi series if all the entries are as awesome as Dream Team is shaping up to be!</p>
