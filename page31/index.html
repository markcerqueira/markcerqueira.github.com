        The Mysterious Research Department
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2013</span>

    <p>Today, I got a cold call from a recruiter: Jeff. I gave him my usual response to recruiters, “Sorry. I’m happy at Smule. If things change, I’ll reach out to you.” Yet, Jeff deserved a little more than this. After all, he somehow dug up my phone number. My interest piqued, I naturally asked Jeff how he got my number. Jeff proudly said, “<strong>Our Research Department</strong>. For candidates we are highly interested in, <strong>Our Research Department</strong> gets their info.” Well, Jeff and other people who like to cold call innocent nerds, here’s a tip for you. In today’s world, where email and text messages are the norms for communication, I only expect calls from family and friends. If you’re a recruiter and you think calling me is going to woo me, you might as well greet me with a big “<strong>SCREW YOU</strong>” because if you’re going to piss me off, you might as well do it with a bang. If you want to grab my attention, <strong>send an email</strong> with something more than a generic copy-and-pasted message. I’m all over the Internet, so get your Research Department to figure out what I like, and use that to grab my attention. I didn’t tell Jeff to put me on his do not call list; I’m hoping this post gets the message across. Have a good day, Jeff!</p>

        Concert Review: Video Games Live, San Francisco, 7/26/13
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2013</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-28/logo.jpg" alt="Video Games Live" /> 
  	<p>On your typical cold summer evening in San Francisco, nerds gathered at Davies Symphony Hall to listen to the SF Symphony and Chorus perform the best kind of music: video game music. Video Games Live is a concert featuring music from popular video game franchises, with video footage accompaniment, synchronized lighting, and even interactive segments for the audience. I grew up playing video games, and still play them today. Yet, video game music plays an even larger role in my life. I listen to video game music at work, I run and work out to video game music, I listen to covers of video game music on YouTube, I write these blog posts listening to video game music, and I count down the days to the release of the next Final Fantasy soundtrack remake. With this kind of passion for video game music, I figured there was absolutely no way Video Games Live could disappoint me. Boy, was I wrong!</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<div class="float-image-left">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-28/tallarico.jpg" alt="Tommy Tallarico" /> 
  	<p>Tommy Tallarico, creator and producer of Video Games Live, made the unfortunate mistake of also making himself emcee and electric guitar frontman for the concert series. Tallarico came off as an obnoxious egomaniac. While he seemed like a good musician, his parading around with his electric guitar in front of a world-class symphony really cheapened the entire experience. After intermission, there was a codec call from Solid Snake. I became giddy about the incoming music from Metal Gear Solid (MGS), but instead heard Snake rally the audience to introduce not the SF Symphony -- but Tallarico. The guy could not stop hogging the spotlight.</p>
</div>

<p>On Video Games Live’s website, Tallarico is described (very likely self-described) as “<strong>one of the most successful video game composers in history</strong>.” Wow, I thought – maybe he isn’t a total hothead, and actually deserves to be in the pantheon of greats like Yasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu, Motoi Sakuraba, and Koji Kondo. Nope – not the case. While Tallarico certainly has an impressive list of games he’s worked on, a large majority are games that I’ve never heard of. Although SpongeBob SquarePants The Movie sounds like a game that has to make its way to my backlog ASAP.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the lighting setup was <strong>terrible</strong>. I’m not sure which was worse: Tallarico, or the in-your-face, seizure-inducing lighting. Perhaps the lighting team did not understand that no, this was not a rock concert. They also forgot there were people on the upper tiers, because the bright lights were often pointed directly in our eyes. The first time this happened, I face palmed, and realized that this was coincidentally really effective at protecting my eyes. When the lights were not pointing at us, they were still doing plenty of damage; the performance of Liberi Fatali (Final Fantasy VIII) was great, but was absolutely ruined by the violently strobing lights. It’s not as if the musicians could not get across Liberi Fatali’s incredible intensity by themselves; they did. The frenetic lights only did them a disservice.</p>

<div>

	<p class="caption-text"><b>If he could play guitar, conduct, and flash lights at my face at the same time, I bet he would!</b></p>
</div>

<p>When it came to music, unfortunately the selection of arrangements was poor, and the passable execution by the SF Symphony and Chorus did not redeem this doomed concert. The Mega Man arrangement suffered from a lack of music from the Mega Man X series; for once, I was actually hoping to see Tallarico shred the Intro Highway Stage Theme of Mega Man X. The inclusion of music from Assassin’s Creed IV and Destiny was uninspiring and had <strong>business partnership</strong> written all over it. The performance of the Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross arrangement featured a terrible arrangement and performance of Time’s Scar. During the violin solo, Tallarico insisted on standing in front of the soloist, who then became barely visible in addition to already being barely audible.</p>

<p>I honestly can’t fault the SF Symphony and Chorus; if I worked with Tallarico on a concert featuring mediocre arrangements and an insanely aggressive light show, I’d have a real hard time taking it seriously. <strong>Recommendation?</strong> If you want a whirlwind introduction to live video game music, are not prone to seizing, and can stand rampant showboating, check out Video Games Live. Otherwise, pass on it, and check out a Zelda Symphony or Distant Worlds concert instead.</p>

        Retrospective - Fast-Grinding in Video Games
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2013</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-23/smt_4.jpg" alt="Shin Megami Tensei IV Box Art" /> 
  	<p>I have been working my way through Shin Megami Tensei IV (SMT4) on my Nintendo 3DS. This series is known for being notoriously difficult, and the latest entry carries on this tradition. As is common in Japanese RPGs (JRPGs), when you get stuck, you grind to power up your party. Grinding is oftentimes a long and arduous process; among my friends who aren't fans of JRPGs, grinding is a common complaint. Coincidentally, there seems to be a new trend emerging to cut down on grinding. Developers, including the ones behind SMT4, are releasing downloadable content (DLC) that allows players to grind more quickly. Here, I reflect on how fast-grinding has changed JRPGs for me.</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p><strong>Fast-grinding saves a ton of time.</strong> If I get stuck fighting an enemy and I’m already exploiting their weaknesses, it’s time to grind. Instead of spending an hour fighting weaker enemies ad infinitum, I can now quickly power up my party, and get back to conquering my earlier roadblock. Once I’m a few hours into a game, I’m normally committed to completing it. Lately, with awesome games coming out left and right, cutting down on grinding propels me through games faster, and avoids intensifying the anxiety I get from <em>video game backlog</em>. For example, SMT4 came out on July 16th and Tales of Xillia (PS3) comes out on August 6th. With fast-grinding available in SMT4, I’m confident I can get through the game before Xillia comes out.</p>

<p><strong>If fast-grinding is used, it shouldn’t break the game.</strong> After grinding in some games, I can mindlessly spam attacks, since most enemies are now comparatively much weaker. In SMT4, even after grinding several levels, I was not an all powerful demigod. After some fast-grinding, battles do become a bit easier; but if I stop paying attention for even a second, I still find myself on the Game Over screen. Via a system of elemental resistances and weaknesses, SMT4 brutally punishes bad strategies, even against weak enemies. <em>Grinding shouldn’t break games, and fast-grinding shouldn’t break games faster</em>.</p>

<p><strong>But something awesome and intrinsic to JRPGs is lost.</strong> There is something twistedly rewarding about grinding. Investing time to power up your party to beat that tough boss gives value to your hard (and often tedious) work. With fast grinding, it’s like winning the lottery every time you run out of money; it quickly takes care of a problem (not having money), but you have something you really didn’t work hard to earn (unless you consider picking numbers hard work). Taking down an über-powerful superboss might not feel very satisfying when it only took a few hours of fast-grinding to build your victorious party. You’ll save time with fast-grinding, but <em>time spent grinding can give value to your gaming experience</em>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think <strong>fast-grinding is a great complement to JRPGs</strong>, and including it is a smart move on developers’ part. So far, I’ve seen it available in SMT4 and Fire Emblem: Awakening (3DS) as paid DLC. The good thing is fast-grinding is not only optional, it costs money, so you always have a good excuse to grind the old fashioned way – which I sometimes prefer. However, while I get joy out of watching characters in games grow, both in story and in stats, I find myself wanting to fast-grind more often than before. Maybe it’s because I’m not a kid anymore; I’ve grown up and lost that nostalgia-inspiring ability to fully dedicate myself to a game. Not to mention, I’ve lost the spare time. So I’m grateful that JRPGs are growing up alongside me.</p>

        LinkedIn's 2.5-Factor Authentication
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2013</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/icon.png" alt="LinkedIn for iOS" style="border: 0px;" /> 
  	<p>Almost a year after its password database was hacked, LinkedIn finally enabled two-factor authentication. Unlike single factor authentication that requires only something a user knows (a password), two-factor authentication also requires something the user possesses. This can be a cell phone that will receive an additional piece of information to prove that you are, in fact, you. LinkedIn's two-factor authentication uses your password and a randomly-generated code that is sent to your cell phone, which is common practice and used by companies like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox. <b>The way</b> LinkedIn presents its two-factor authentication is where the company really shines... And not in a good way!</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 594px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/dbauth.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>2-factor authentication on the Dropbox iOS app.</b></p>
</div>

<p>First, let’s look at how Facebook (version 6.3) and Dropbox (version 2.3) handle two-factor authentication on iOS. You start by entering your email and password. If those are correct, you’re past the first stage of authentication. You are informed that your phone will be sent a code (the second piece of authentication), and then you’re brought to a screen with a number pad. You receive a text message with the promised code and are able to input the code. After passing two methods of authentication, you’re in!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 594px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/fbauth.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>2-factor authentication on the Facebook iOS app. Note the inconsistency with which Facebook refers to the security code.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Everything is simple and clean, aside from Facebook being inconsistent in what it calls the security code: the app states that you will get a <strong>code</strong> via SMS, then calls that code a <strong>password</strong> in the SMS, and then asks for a <strong>Login Approval Code</strong> in the app. Dropbox keeps things much more consistent: stating a <strong>security code</strong> will be sent to your phone, calling that code a <strong>security code</strong> in its text message, and then asking for a <strong>6-digit code</strong> in the app.</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at LinkedIn (version 6.1). Everything starts out similarly. You enter your email and password, and if those are correct, you proceed to the next step of authentication. It looks like this:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 594px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/liauth.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>Wait... I have to do what!?</b></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Why would they have me append my security code to my password – in the same field!?</strong> Their iOS team forgoes implementing a new screen, the server team picks up the slack and separates the security code from the password, and the user is left dumbfounded as to why LinkedIn took an entire year since their password leak to send two-factor authentication to an alternate realm of terrible user experiences.</p>

<p>Well, at least the instructions in the app and the text message are consistent; let’s just follow the instructions and be finished with this. I dismiss the UIAlertView by hitting the OK button, the text message comes in with the code, I switch to the numeric/symbol mode of the keyboard of which I will only use the numbers, and I carefully input the first number. Lo and behold, my password that was formerly there is gone!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 594px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-17/liauth2.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>Just when you thought things couldn't get worse...</b></p>
</div>

<p>That’s right. When the text message says <strong>Enter your LinkedIn password followed by: 123456</strong>, whether by accident or design, it literally means type your password in <strong>AGAIN</strong>, but add these 6 digits to the end. Perhaps this is some new hybrid of 2-factor authentication – enter your password, and then enter your password again, but add a security code to the end. It’s silly. You don’t need to sacrifice convenience for added security. So for now, I’ll just assume this is a big joke on LinkedIn’s part…</p>

        My Biggest Video Game Time Sink
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2013</span>

    <p>The editors at Game Informer recently did a feature series on games they’d spent a huge amount of time playing: <strong>time sinks</strong>. The games ranged from new games like Minecraft to classics like Pokémon Red and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I’ll unabashedly admit that I have spent an obscene amount of time playing video games. This shouldn’t come as a surprise considering my favorite genre is Japanese RPGs (JRPGs), which usually take at least 20 hours to get through the main storyline. I put 122 hours into Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii) and 60+ hours into Dragon Quest IX (DS) and Valkyrie Profile(PSX). But there is one JRPG on the Playstation 2 that I played for a staggering <strong>227 hours</strong>!</p>

<!--break-->

<p>I’m a Final Fantasy fan. My first hit was Final Fantasy VIII (PSX). Through repeated playthroughs, one involving collecting all the cards in the Triple Triad card game, I easily put in over 90 hours into this game. I even got Squall’s second best weapon before the first SeeD mission, by refining the cards I collected into the items necessary to make the powerful gunblade. But 90 hours pales in comparison to the 227 I invested in the first Final Fantasy released on the PS2 – <strong>Final Fantasy X</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 594px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-11/227hours.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>227 hours!</b></p>
</div>

<p>There are plenty of ways to pour time into FFX. I got the powerful Celestial Weapons. I took the worst Blitzball team in Spira, the Besaid Aurochs, and turned them into dominant tyrants. I dodged 200 lightening bolts in the Thunder Plains. The Monster Arena also quickly ran out of monsters that could even scratch my party. That said, even doing all this could not account for 227 hours. One day I stumbled on a GameFAQs guide to max out characters’ stats… And I took the dive!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 594px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-11/ffxstats.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Top: </strong>Maxed out stats for Tidus and Yuna.<br />
		<strong>Bottom-left: </strong>Yuna's Aeons benefiting from her maxed out stats.<br />
		<strong>Bottom-right: </strong>The Sphere Grid -- heavily modified to max out stats.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is a quick overview of how you do this. In FFX, you power up your characters by fighting enemies to earn points, which allows you to collect power ups from the Sphere Grid. On this grid, there are various nodes that grant various power ups to your characters (e.g. Magic up, Strength up). Some nodes are more powerful than others. For example, you can have a node that only increases Strength by 1 and another that increases it by 4. Special items also enable you to modify the sphere grid. For example, with a certain item, you can erase nodes. On the other hand, certain monsters drop items which allow you to create nodes that award the max boost for each stat. From here, it’s just a matter of erasing every node that does not award the maximum boost to a particular stat and replacing it with a node that does. Rinse and repeat until you max out the 8 bits allocated to each stat – 255.</p>

<p>Why? I think the completionist in me took over and went into overdrive. Aside from not maxing out Luck to 255, the only disappointment is that I played the North American version of FFX. The International Version of FFX, released only in Europe, features tough superbosses that would’ve been fun to challenge (i.e. destroy) with my maxed out characters.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 594px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-11/ffxhd.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text"><b>It's almost time to play this game some more.</b></p>
</div>

<p>But Final Fantasy X isn’t done consuming my time! An HD remaster of Final Fantasy X is quickly approaching. But this isn’t a plain old remaster of the version I played on the PS2. This is the International Version that features those aforementioned superbosses, and even some brand new content. These days, I don’t replay games because my video game backlog is huge and life has gotten busier compared to my halcyon days. But it was during those days that I heard Tidus deliver the first lines of this game, “Listen to my story… This may be our last chance.” Well, I guess I can make an exception. Sign me up – we’re going to Spira again!</p>
