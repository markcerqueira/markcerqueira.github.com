        How I Sous Vide

    <p>Sous vide is the <del>hot</del> <del>cool</del> warm new way to cook things. French for “under vacuum,” sous vide takes the guesswork out of cooking: simply grab the meat, vacuum seal it, throw it in a water bath, and wait. Give it some time and boom! Your meat is perfectly cooked!</p>

</div>

<p>A few friends have asked about <strong>my setup</strong>. I compiled my equipment in an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/giftlist/2Y71VOG9O5OYJ">Amazon gift list</a>, which includes almost everything I use. The list looks (and is) long (and ultimately, expensive), but here are a few important points worth mentioning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To get started you really only need a <strong>circulator</strong>. The circulator can be attached to any large pot you already have and you can seal your food inside regular Ziploc bags. The Modernist Cooking blog has a great post on <a href="http://www.amazingfoodmadeeasy.com/info/modernist-cooking-blog/more/how-to-use-ziploc-bags-for-sous-vide">how to get a nice seal using regular Ziploc bags</a>.</li>
  <li>A <strong>vacuum sealer</strong> will let you get an excellent seal on anything you are putting in the water bath. I have the Waring Pro Pistol Sealer and have had no issues with it. While doing research for this post I discovered you can get <a href="http://seattlefoodgeek.com/2011/06/ziploc-vacuum-bags-vs-foodsaver-for-sous-vide-at-home/">great vacuum seals</a> for much cheaper using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UEMFUG"><strong>Ziploc Vaccum Starter Kit</strong></a>.</li>
  <li>You can attach your circulator to a container or pot you already have, but a <strong>polycarbonate container with a lid</strong> is better at retaining heat which helps your circulator keep the water at the perfect temperature. I used a Dremel tool to cut a circle in my lid so the circulator can be placed in and stays in place without the attachment accessory.</li>
  <li>You can eat meat straight out of the water bath, but <strong>searing</strong> gives your flabby piece of meat more flavor and a better texture profile. To sear, you can use a pan you already have.</li>
  <li>For improved searing, get a <strong>cast-iron skillet</strong> which can get hotter (and retain that hot temperature more easily) compared to an aluminum or stainless steel pan. You can put your cast-iron skillet in the oven at a very high temperature and then pull it out when you’re ready to sear the meat. At a very high temperature, you only need to sear each side of the steak for about 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>To sear in style, get a <strong>torch</strong>! To sear in the greatest of style, get the <strong>Searzall Torch attachment</strong> which takes your torch game to the max! When searing with a torch, I lay the meat on <strong>cookie pan</strong>. These pans can handle the heat, are lightweight, and are easy to clean.</li>
  <li>I use <strong>tongs</strong> to turn, flip, and move the meat. I avoid using forks because the first thing that breaks into the meat should be the diner’s utensils. A turner could work too, but that could get a bit hairy when you have heavy slabs of meat!</li>
  <li>The only thing missing from the Amazon gift list are the <strong>Propane Gas Cylinders</strong> which I buy at <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Bernzomatic-1-lb-Camping-Gas-Cylinders-2-Pack-332773/205367341">Home Depot</a> because prices on Amazon are much higher due to increased shipping costs for flammable products.</li>
  <li>The overall temperature of anything cooked by sous vide never gets really high (e.g. steaks in the water bath in the 130-140° F range). To avoid that cold food feeling, I recommend <strong>warming up (oven-safe) plates in the oven</strong> prior to serving food. A few minutes in the oven around 170° F gets the plates nice and toasty and helps compensate for the low temperature cooking.</li>
</ul>

<p>And there we have it! If you have any questions about sous vide or I’m missing out on some killer piece of hardware or some amazing technique <a href="https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira">tweet at me</a>!</p>

        Evernote Academy Insider Perspective
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>Evernote was recently featured on a Glassdoor blog post titled <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/top-20-employee-benefits-perks/">Top 20 Employee Benefits &amp; Perks</a>. Evernote got on this list because of <strong>Evernote Academy</strong>: a range of courses offered to employees with some taught by employees themselves. Here’s an insider perspective on both leading and taking an Evernote Academy course.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2016-03-06/academy.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Evernoters from USA, Japan, Korea, and China unite to learn Java and the Evernote SDK!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Last year I was fortunate to work out of the Evernote Japan office for a few weeks. A few months ago, a member of our Japan team contacted me asking if I’d be interested in teaching a programming course centered around the <a href="https://dev.evernote.com/doc/">Evernote SDK</a> for employees without coding experience. It sounded like a fun time, so I agreed and the first ever <strong>international</strong> Evernote Academy course was held; led from the USA by myself with participants from our Japan, Korea, and China offices. Over two one-hour courses, we covered the <strong>basics of Java</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/markcerqueira/hello-java">hello-java on GitHub</a>) (Android is Java-based, Java was my first language) and we developed a <strong>Java application</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/markcerqueira/javanote">javanote on GitHub</a>) that pulled currency conversion rates using <a href="http://fixer.io">fixer.io</a> and created a note in Evernote with that information.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2016-03-06/source.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Source code (heavily commented) is linked in the paragraph above!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>I found the teaching experience very fulfilling. My goal was for fellow Evernoters participating to walk away with a basic understanding of how programming works, what an SDK is, and how SDKs can be used to extend services and glue together different services. All participants walked away with a better understanding of Java, the Evernote SDK, and SDKs in general. Naturally, the entire experience put everyone involved in contact with people within the Evernote organization that they may have never met. Many of us grew beyond being just a name and photo in the company directory. Evernote isn’t a huge company, but it’s large (and spread out around the world enough) that finding non-cheesy (e.g. icebreakers) ways to get new people working together is a challenge. Beyond the primary goal of providing employees with new knowledge and experiences, Evernote Academy has many beneficial side-effects.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Rule #1 of lock-picking: don't be a jerk and only pick your own locks!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Both teaching and taking an Evernote course is a blast, except taking one involves way less preparation! Just in the past month, I’ve taken two awesome classes. One was a course on <strong>lock-picking</strong> led by an Evernoter who is a hobbyist lock-picker! We learned the basics of lock-picking (e.g. the flaw in all locks that makes lock-picking possible), the legality of lock-picking (e.g. don’t be a jerk and only pick locks you own), and – of course – picked various locks that ranged in difficult from really easy to “your apartment lock difficult.” It was fun and something I would’ve never considered trying if it didn’t fall right in my lap.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Buried deep down inside this engineer is an artist and a gardener.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>And the second class I took was on <strong>building a vertical succulent garden.</strong> Ali, a designer on the team who is also a floral designer, led the course on building a little garden that you could hang on the wall or use as a centerpiece. She walked us through the basics of designing a succulent garden, how to build a vertical garden, and then we put that knowledge to use! If I can produce something that doesn’t look terrible (dare I say it looks good!?), you know you’ve got some quality instruction! Check out Ali’s awesome work on <a href="http://alialbiani.com/floral/">her website</a>.</p>

<p>I’m deep into my second year at Evernote and loving every minute of the ride. I love all the excellent food we get at Evernote… my increasing waistline does not. But Evernote Academy is quickly working its way up the ladder of things I love about working at Evernote. If you’re hungry for food or to learn new things, you’re in luck: Evernote is hiring! Check out our <a href="https://evernote.com/careers/">Careers</a> page for open opportunities and satisfy that hunger!</p>

        Underscores in Java Numbers

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>Following <a href="/2015/04/26/thats-allowed-in-java/">variable shadowing</a> and <a href="/2016/02/12/try-catch-finally-blocks/">catch-less try blocks</a>, today we explore another cool little Java thing I learned about the other day: underscores in Java numeric literals.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="c1">// Declaring a few "numbers" with underscores to make them more readable</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">oneMillion</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="n">_000_000</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>Unlike variable shadowing and catch-less try blocks, <strong>underscores in numeric literals makes things clearer and more readable</strong> so I encourage using them!</p>

<p>Read more about this handy little language feature and see more examples in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/underscores-literals.html">official Java documentation</a>.</p>

        try-catch-finally blocks

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>It’s always pleasant to learn something new about a language you’ve been using for a while. Turns out when you declare a try block, <strong>you don’t need a catch block</strong>. You ALWAYS need a catch OR a finally block, but the catch block is not required if you have a finally block. This is valid Java:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">crashProneMethod</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">try</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">badString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">badString</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">finally</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Clean up if needed</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What is practical usage of this? If you wanted your method to catch an exception but let the method caller handle it, you could skip catching and re-throwing the exception in your method. That looks something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="c1">// Note that this method signature specifies that this method throws an Exception</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">crashProneMethod</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">Exception</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">try</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">badString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">;</span>

	<span class="c1">// This won't crash but the caller of crashProneMethod will</span>
	<span class="c1">// need to wrap the call to crashProneMethod in a try-catch </span>
	<span class="c1">// (or try-finally) block. This lets you "catch" the exception </span>
	<span class="c1">// and throw it to the caller without having to manually call throw. </span>
    <span class="n">badString</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">finally</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Clean up if needed</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is a decently cool trick, but like <a href="/2015/04/26/thats-allowed-in-java/">variable shadowing in Java</a>, it’s probably better to explicitly catch the exception and throw it because it makes your code more readable. But if you’re into exercising a language to make your code more difficult to read, try-finally away!</p>

    <p>Want to push and pull some <strong>Base64</strong> from <strong>SharedPreferences</strong>? You’ll need to do some String to byte[] conversion to get it done. First, I (foolishly) tried using toString() on a byte[] but that won’t work! The String constructor saves the day!</p>
