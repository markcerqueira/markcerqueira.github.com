        Portuglish Words
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2013</span>

    <p>Visiting home, where Portuguese is the dominant language, I am constantly reminded of my deteriorating command of my native tongue. Yet today, I realized that there are words my Portuguese-American family uses that would probably leave my relatives living in Portugal pretty perplexed. These are bastard words: born out of an unholy union between English and Portuguese. I bet most Luso-Americans will know what these words mean, but most Portuguese people will just give you strange looks if you drop one of these gems around them. Here is a small (and very casual) ethnographic look at some uniquely Portuglish words.</p>

<p><strong>liquostore</strong> - Portuguese people love their libations, yet the proper translation of liquor store is <em>loja de bebidas</em>. There are far too many syllables there, so let’s just go with liquostore.</p>

<p><strong>sneaka</strong> - Sounds a lot like sneaker and that’s exactly what a Luso-American might call them instead of the proper <em>sapatilhas</em> or <em>ténis</em>.</p>

<p><strong>zinko</strong> - This morphing of sink reminds me of transliterated Japanese words that often end in a vowel. You have a sink? A Luso-American has a zinko (zink-koo). A Portuguese person has a <em>pia</em>.</p>

<p><strong>parquear</strong> - Interestingly enough, this was the only verb I could come up with. Used instead of the proper <em>estacionar</em>, this word means “to park a car.”</p>

<p><strong>estoa</strong> - This word takes “store” and adds some more vowels to it. The proper Portuguese word for store is <em>loja</em>.</p>

<p>These were the ones that I could come up with, but I’m sure there are more. If you know any, <a href="https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira">send me a tweet</a>!</p>

    <span class="post-date">24 Dec 2013</span>

    <p>Sometimes you need to write cringe-inducing code. The other day, I was trying to figure out when the Android keyboard was present and not present. Unlike iOS, Android doesn’t provide convenient ways to detect when the keyboard appears and disappears. I found a “solution” that keeps track of the size of the root view of the activity; if its display frame is smaller than the actual height of the view, a keyboard is likely present. To detect this I added a global layout listener to my root view’s view tree. When I went to remove it, I ended up having to write this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nd">@SuppressWarnings</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"deprecation"</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">// no words for this sadness...</span>
<span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">stopListeningForKeyboardDismissal</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Build</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">VERSION</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">SDK_INT</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Build</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">VERSION_CODES</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH_MR1</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">mRootView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getViewTreeObserver</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">removeOnGlobalLayoutListener</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">mKeyboardPresentListener</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">mRootView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getViewTreeObserver</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">removeGlobalOnLayoutListener</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">mKeyboardPresentListener</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The method remove<strong>GlobalOn</strong>LayoutListener was introduced in API level 1, but it did not follow the naming conventions in the ViewTreeObserver class. So it was deprecated and replaced by remove<strong>OnGlobal</strong>LayoutListener in API level 16. What would happen if you didn’t call these properly? Just a NoSuchMethodError exception that would cause much sadness. Good troll, Google. Good troll.</p>

    <p>When I first discovered Android’s “Don’t keep activities” developer option, I jumped for nerd joy. You’re telling me I can force the Android operating system to be aggressive and destroy my activities every time I leave them? YES PLEASE. The end result is defensive code that will work better in low-memory situations. Getting all your activities destroyed as soon you leave them likely won’t happen under normal circumstances (more likely to happen on cheaper, low memory devices). But it’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially when you want to keep your customers happy and engaged with your product.</p>

<p>The other day I decided to give GoToMeeting a try on an Android device and was greeted with this:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-12-20/gotomeeting.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Really!?</b></p>
</div>

<p>I’m not even going to mince words; this is Citrix’s development team being <strong>LAZY</strong>. That option was added so developers could make their apps more stable. It wasn’t added so developers could detect it was turned on and then FORCE users to leave their app and turn it off. And I’m not asking for the moon here because it’s not difficult to make your app work with that option turned on. You’ve got bundled instance state to save any pertinent data that can be retrieved upon activity recreation. Even complex objects can be bundled if you make them implement the Parcelable interface. In a rare moment, the Android SDK actually impressed me.</p>

<p>This isn’t rocket science. It’s caring about making a decent product – something the Citrix team doesn’t seem to care much about.</p>

    <p>Anime is a little known nerd interest of mine. However, I don’t have time to indulge in it as much as I’d like to. Fortunately, these things can be fixed! Over the past few months, I picked out 7 films/shows and took care of some much-needed business. Here are some quick reviews with <strong>watch</strong> or <strong>pass</strong> recommendations.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-12-05/anime-titan.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b></b></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Attack on Titan</strong> is set in a medieval setting with one technological advancement: Vertical Maneuvering Equipment that allows humans to move around quickly by latching onto structures, and reeling themselves in. Large humanoid titans - that feed on humans - emerged 100 years ago, and humanity has retreated into a city surrounded by three very tall walls. Humanity’s struggle against the titans is depressing and gruesome; even when humans take a small victory, it is tainted with hopelessness. That said, it’s definitely worth watching if you can stomach lots of slaughter and bone-crushing. There’s another season coming, but I can’t wait so I’m going to read the manga. Verdict: <strong>Watch</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Guilty Crown</strong> is a Code Geass clone through and through: a boy meets a strange girl, gets a special power, joins an anti-government group, becomes a hero, then turns evil, and ends up redeeming himself at the end. But there were way too many loose ends at the end of the series. In the end, Code Geass just did everything better, so watch that instead of this. Verdict: <strong>Pass</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Durarara!!</strong> - It seems like it’s a slice-of-life show about a small-town kid moving to a big city. But then it adds a few twists when that city has a headless motorcyclist, demonic possessions, an anonymous Internet-based gang, and humans with supernatural strength. Durarara took a few episodes to pick up steam, but I really enjoyed the show. The plot features a pleasant mix of real-world and fantastical elements that never seemed forced. And while there is your usual protagonist, the show did a great job of exploring and developing the eclectic mix of characters. Verdict: <strong>Watch</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>5 Centimeters per Second</strong> - An animated feature film that hit me right in the feels. Split into three acts, the film follows a boy named Takaki who grows close to a childhood friend - Akari - who eventually relocates to a different town. The film explores how people grow apart slowly over time, like cherry blossom petals that fall slowly away from each other at 5 centimeters per second. The story itself is troperiffic, but it’s the presentation of this film that really shines. This film is chock-filled with beautiful, awe-inspiring scenes backed by an incredible musical score. Clocking in at barely over an hour, it’s definitely worth checking out. Verdict: <strong>Watch</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Xam’d: Lost Memories</strong> - A story about two warring countries, and a guy who gets some magical powers – who for some reason then proceeds to work on an airship delivering mail. Oh, and occasionally fighting baddies. Seriously, this anime confused me. From the get-go a lot of the characters and their motives were too difficult to grasp, so any development on said things produced little value. The mysterious powers bestowed upon the protagonist are also never fleshed out to my satisfaction. After completing the series I read up on it and the consensus was that Xam’d was good, but not for everyone. I guess I’m one of those that it isn’t for. Verdict: <strong>Pass</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</strong> - What starts out as two teenagers escaping their underground village to see the surface world ends up becoming a fight of universal proportions. This show felt like Dragon Ball Z with mechs. Although much shorter in length (27 episodes), whenever there was an insurmountable challenge, you could count on lots of yelling, new power-ups, and fusions. The show is also filled with strong, unique personalities that make even the slower segments enjoyable to watch. A lot of my friends recommended I watch this and I finally got around to it; you should too! Verdict: <strong>Watch</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</strong> - The story of two young siblings, Mirai and Yuki, who meet a single mother, Mari, after a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hits Tokyo. The three trudge through the now-destroyed city trying to make their way home safely. Simultaneously a dramatic, sad, heart-warming story that you should watch with a box of tissues near.

        Passive Video Gaming
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Nov 2013</span>

    <p>Whether you consider video games a means of entertainment or a work of art, video games are consumable goods. Normally, we think of consumers as active gamers. However, since the advent of video gaming, there has been another way to consume video games: <strong>passively</strong>.</p>

<!--break-->

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Back in the day, this was hanging out at your friend's house while he trudged through Super Mario Brothers. Today, if you just want to sit back and watch some video gaming, you don't even need a friend nearby... or friends at all, if you're not into that kind of thing. Your options are plentiful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Watch a Let’s Play series on YouTube in which a gamer plays (and frequently narrates) a video game.</li>
  <li>Watch someone play a game live online via a streaming service like Twitch TV.</li>
  <li>Watch professionally produced eSports events like the StarCraft 2 or League of Legends Championship Series.</li>
  <li>If you’re feeling old-school, find a gamer friend, go to your their house, and kick back.</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-11-30/passive-sc2.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>A sea of nerds watching a StarCraft 2 tournament.</b></p>
</div>

<p>I consider myself an avid video gamer; I plow through a good number of video games per year. Yet, I find myself consuming video games regularly via all the avenues listed above. After a shamefully delayed completion of Chrono Trigger in 2012, I decided to replay the sequel Chrono Cross, but I ended up watching lucahjin’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBD691EACF14FB4F3">Let’s Play Chrono Trigger</a> series on YouTube instead. And while I enjoy playing StarCraft 2, I definitely watch other people play the game more than I play myself – whether it’s professionals in the World Championship Series or community members live streaming their gameplay. And the options for passive gaming have gotten a significant boost given the PS4 and Xbox One feature live streaming integration.</p>

<p>I’ve grown up (just a little) and consequently, my time and priorities have shifted. While “active” gaming still occupies a good amount of my time, I find myself turning to passive consumption when I have other things to do (that don’t require my undivided attention) or just want to unwind and do nothing (like a good American boy). When I watch professionals duke it out, I watch because it’s both entertaining and amazing to see people play a game at such a high level.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2013-11-30/passive-ta.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>The Casting Archon Tastosis: Tasteless and Artosis.</b></p>
</div>

<p>StarCraft 2 events even feature well-known community personalities, like Tasteless and Artosis, who commentate events. Not only do the actual players competing in tournaments have fans, even the people commentating and hosting these events have large fan-bases! I’ll admit that I would watch Tasteless and Artosis talk about drying paint and probably get a good kick out of it.</p>

<p>I don’t think passive gaming is a bad thing. We’ve gotten to the point where watching other people play video games is actually a thing – some people even make a living off of streaming themselves playing! Last year, my girlfriend and I had a great time watching Day[9] drag his pansy ass (and scream like a little girl) through Amnesia - The Dark Descent; it’s a fond memory for both of us even though neither of us actually played the game. He is a braver man than I.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Some fan art inspired by Day9's Let's Play of Amnesia.</b></p>
</div>

<p>That said, it’s also affecting what games I plan to play in the future. Blizzard’s new trading card game, Hearthstone, has had several months in an open beta. I’ve watched a bunch of people stream it, and even a live competition. When the game does come out, I know I won’t be very excited for it because I’ve essentially sat through a lot of other people’s gameplay and have vicariously experienced the game through them. If I choose not to play it, I don’t think there is a huge loss there.</p>
