        Olá Francesinha!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2015</span>

    <p>It’s been five years since I was last in Portugal. One thing I was excited about (besides seeing family) was eating a <strong>francesinha</strong>: the ultimate sandwich. This is a francesinha.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-07-10/dna.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Francesinha from Café DNA (Vila de Arcos de Valdevez)</strong></p>
</div>

<p>It looks like a sandwich on a plate covered in sauce. <strong>But it’s way more than that!</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>sandwich</strong> contains all sorts of meats including steak, ham, smoked pork sausage (linguiça), fresh sausage (chipolata), and maybe some other meats depending on where you get it. It’s topped off with a ton of queijo (cheese), an ovo estrelado (fried egg), and a side of batata frita (fries). Your arteries deserve to be clogged.</p>

<p>The sandwich is imposing, but it’s really the <strong>molho (sauce)</strong> that makes the francesinha special. Recipes are well-kept secrets but the common ingredient in them all is <strong>cerveja (beer)</strong>. It varies from place to place and the sauce is usually what people will argue about when discussing their favorite francesinha.</p>

<p>The sauce varies from place to place, but the entire dish is sometimes reimagined. The Portuguese no longer explore the seas. Instead, they <strong>search for culinary paradise</strong>. For example, at <a href="http://restaurantesmauritania.com/index.php/mauritaniagrill">Mauritânia Grill</a> in Leça de Palmeira, Porto (the hometown of the francesinha) you can get a francesinha that comes loaded with a ton of seafood like shrimp, prawns, mussels, barnacles, clams.</p>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Francesinha Artilhada from Mauritânia Grill</strong></p>

<p>I’ll miss you so much francesinha. Até já (until we meet again)!</p>

    <p>The day will be <strong>December 4th, 2015</strong>. The sadness of not knowing when <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X</strong> is coming to North America is over. It has been replaced by both sadness and anticipation that it’s a little under half a year away.</p>

<p>There were a lot of exciting announcements at this year’s E3, but a release date out of the Nintendo and Monolith Soft camp is all I wanted. We even got another trailer that features those iconic Hiroyuki Sawano-esque vocals right when you have robots epically gliding over water!</p>

    <p>My Bash profile is critical to keeping me <strong>elite</strong> on the command-line. Keeping myself elite across multiple computers is also very easy with Dropbox (or your file syncing service du jour). Then I create a very, very simple .bash_profile that looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">~ cat .bash_profile

<span class="nb">source</span> ~/Dropbox/Bash/main.sh</code></pre></figure>

<p>This grabs the contents of main.sh from a folder in my Dropbox and effectively puts it in the .bash_profile file. What does main.sh look like?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">~ cat ~/Dropbox/Bash/main.sh 

<span class="c"># Git Power Up!</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> ~/Dropbox/Bash/git-completion.sh

<span class="c"># Android</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> ~/Dropbox/Bash/android.sh

<span class="c"># Evernote</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> ~/Dropbox/Bash/evernote.sh

<span class="c"># The rest including everything and the kitchen sink...</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I separate things out a little more to keep things modular and keep similar functionality together, which makes everything a little easier to both maintain and read.</p>

<p>I don’t update these files very often, but anytime I do, it’ll get synced automagically. The sad days of typing a new alias on a computer and seeing “command not found” are gone!</p>

        Running in Japan
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>I’m heading home today. I did and saw a lot in Japan. One thing I’m really happy I did in Japan was <strong>run</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-06-08/japan-run.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>A run around The Imperial Palace in Tokyo</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Running in the morning was a great way to start my days and do a bit of <strong>drive-by sight-seeing</strong>. Not only did running make me feel less terrible about all the food and beer I was consuming, it let me get lost in a new place. Each morning, I’d pick a direction or landmark and run. If I saw something cool I’d take a break, snap a picture, and get back to it.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-06-08/zojo.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Sights to see! Zōjō-ji and Tokyo Tower</strong></p>
</div>

<p>With 80+ miles (humblebrag) logged of running in Japan, here are some tips on running in Japan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Tokyo, run around parks or The Imperial Palace so you can avoid intersections where you may need to wait a while.</li>
  <li>Avoid running inside parks because it’s usually not allowed.</li>
  <li>Learn to bow while running. When running past police officers, I sometimes did a running bow and greeted them. I think they appreciated it.</li>
  <li>Bring a camera! You probably are already using a running app to track your run so you already have a camera on you.</li>
  <li>In Kyoto, the Kamo River cuts the city in half. The path along the river is great for running.</li>
  <li>Bring a data-connected phone because you will likely get lost. Google Maps will make sure your 8 mile run doesn’t end 8 miles from where you’re staying!</li>
  <li>If you’re running during rush hours, avoid major train stations and streets since they’ll be filled with people walking.</li>
  <li>Don’t expect to set any records. I was stopping frequently to snap photos of all the nice scenes I was running past.</li>
  <li>Tokyo is big. If you want to be somewhere centrally located, check out Akasaka. From there you have a lot of directions to branch out.</li>
  <li>Stop by a French bakery in a train station after your run and deliciously undo your one hour run in five minutes!</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy running wherever you are!</p>

        Japan is Cool, But...
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>My month-long excursion to Japan is winding down. It’s been a blast! Japan is a great country filled with wonderfully awesome people, wonderfully clean toilets, and wonderfully delicious food.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-06-04/oko.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Japan is so beautiful...</strong></p>
</div>

<p>But if I told everyone everything is all sunshine and rainbows here, people would be a bit skeptical of my assessment so here’s a <strong>very serious</strong> list of things that <del>slightly irk</del> absolutely infuriate me about Japan.</p>

<p><strong>WASTED PACKAGING</strong> - Man, Japanese people LOVE packaging. Bought a piece of bread? It’ll get put in a little plastic bag and then that will get put in a bigger plastic bag. Bought a small jar of pickled sakura? Let me wrap it in fancy wrapping paper and then put it in a small plastic bag and then put that bag in another plastic bag.</p>

<p><strong>NO TRASH CANS</strong> - This makes how ridiculously clean Japan is even more amazing. There are so few trash cans anywhere so I found myself carrying my trash around with me until I found a convenience store. Even the places I was staying at only had very small trash cans!</p>

<p><strong>CASH-LOVING COUNTRY</strong> - For a country that is be such a technological powerhouse, it’s a freaking shame I had to carry cash around with me all the time because most places just take cash.</p>

<!--break-->

<p><strong>BICYCLES ON SIDEWALKS</strong> - I think the sidewalks of Tokyo get more traffic than the streets do. You’d figure bicyclists would share the streets with cars, but no – bicyclists ride on already-crowded sidewalks. And if a bicyclist gets stuck behind you behind you, don’t expect them to act like Bay Area bicyclist snobs and announce their holier-than-thou presence so you can move; they’ll just quietly roll behind you until a space opens up for them to ride past you.</p>

<p><strong>TRAINS GO TO SLEEP</strong> - The Japanese rail system is ridiculously awesome. Trains are always on time and come so often that missing a train isn’t so bad. You only need to wait a few minutes before the next one comes. But between 1 AM and 5 AM the trains stop running completely and this is kind of disappointing. Then again, this encourages karaoking all night and taking the 5 AM train home… Not so bad after all!</p>

<p><strong>AVOID ROPPONGI</strong> - My only actual negative experience in Japan was when I decided to go have dinner with a friend in Roppongi on Friday night. Roppongi is known for having an active nightlife. But we were just harassed persistently during our search for a place to eat by sleazy promoters promising us beer, women, and good times. First of all, that sounds way too good to be true so there must be some trickery at the end where you take all my money. Second, leave me alone – I want to eat some ramen!</p>

<p><strong>ESCALATOR ETHICS STANDARDIZATION</strong> - Everything is switched in Japan. People drive on the left, drivers sit on the right, and people standing on the escalator instead of walking on it stand on the left so walkers can pass on the right. These escalator ethics apply everywhere except – as far as I know – to Osaka and some random station in Tokyo. Standardize please!</p>

<p><strong>SHINJUKU STATION IS TOO BIG</strong> - Seriously, this train station, which is the busiest transit hub in the world, is freaking huge. If Google Maps tells you you need to go to one of Shinjuku’s 36 (!!) train platforms, add a little buffer window to your expected travel time because you may be walking a long time in this behemoth. Also, if you’re on one side of Shinjuku station and you need to be on the opposite side, good luck!</p>

<p>Thanks Japan. For being awesome, but also having these <del>so very minor</del> incredibly disturbing flaws.</p>
