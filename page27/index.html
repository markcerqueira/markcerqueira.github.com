    <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>I’ll never forget the first video game I ever played: Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES). And I’ll never forget the first time I fell in love with a game: Super Mario RPG and the Legend of the Seven Stars (SNES). Times have changed and so have I, and the <em>magic</em> of video games seems to have waned. So in order not to feel disappointed most of the time, I tell myself, “You’re not a kid anymore. It’s not going to be as magical anymore.” Yet, there are rare moments when I feel like a kid all over again. It’s moments like these that I realize I’m playing a game that is going to join the Pantheon of Greats, which features amazing (mostly JRPG) games like Xenoblade, Chrono Trigger, Terranigma, Final Fantasy VI, Valkyrie Profile, and Grandia II.</p>

<div>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>The newest member of the Pantheon of Greats: Persona 4 Golden.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Most recently, this happened with Persona 4 Golden (P4G) for the Playstation Vita. It was truly a game that excited me from start to finish. An enhanced re-release of the PS2 original, P4G knocked my socks off. I don’t need to write a long rave review about this game; there are already plenty of them out there. In short, this game is novel, quirky (in the best way), wonderfully designed, and was <em>an absolute pleasure to play and experience</em>. Even though exposure to lots of video games as well as adulthood has made me feel jaded at times, I am happy to report that there is still magic out there…. So the hunt continues!</p>

        Bravely Default Demo Review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2014</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/cover.jpg" alt="Bravely Default Flying Fairy" /> 
  	<p>I did something strange this past week. I played a demo for a game &mdash; something I don't usually do. And I played it for a whopping seven hours. The 3DS is on a quest to hog up all my gaming time and with high caliber games &mdash; like Bravely Default &mdash; on the horizon, it's doing a great job. I was impressed with the demo for Bravely Default from start to finish. Here are some of my thoughts on the game so far.</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<ul>
  <li>Bravely Default’s <strong>demo</strong> is also just cool in and of itself. Many demos are just a random slice of the full game. But Bravely Default’s demo actually features quests that don’t exist in the full game. In addition, there are item set perks you can earn for completing these demo quests, which transfer over to the full game. None of these are game-breaking bonuses either, so you’re not ruining the challenge of the game. They’ll just help out your gold wallet early on when gold is tight!</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="width: 500px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/battle.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>"Default" in battle to build up turns for later.</b></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>battle system</strong> is straight old-school with a minor twist based on the game’s odd title. In battle, you can choose to Default which is the equivalent of defending. Using Default also grants you an extra Battle Point (BP). On the other hand, you can spend BP via the Brave command to input multiple commands (e.g. Attack, cast a spell, and then heal your party) all in one turn. Your party starts with 0 BP each battle and you can go negative with your BP. If you’re sure you can wipe the enemy out in one turn, you can Brave all your characters to -4 BP and wail away at the enemy. If the enemy doesn’t die, you’re in trouble because until you have 0 BP, you cannot act again. You are effectively in BP debt. Each turn restores 1 BP – so you better hope the enemies don’t wipe you out while you sit there helplessly for 4 turns! Are you going to play it safe or go balls to the wall and try to destroy your enemy?</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/jobs.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>4 of the 26 available jobs: Pirate, Spell Fencer, Valkyrie, Vampire.</b></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>job system</strong> is pretty dang cool. It reminded me a lot of Final Fantasy V. After each battle, your characters earn experience which levels up the character and their base stats. But you also earn job points which level up the job your characters currently have selected. The game features standard jobs like Black Mage, Knight, Ninja, but also more quirky jobs like Pirate, Vampire, Valkyrie, and Spell Fencer. As you level jobs up you gain access to active combat abilities and passive skills. When you switch jobs, you can mix and match these active and passive skills, so leveling up different jobs is encouraged. For example, while playing the demo, I found the Knight’s “Two-Hand” ability, which means the character sacrifices holding a shield and instead holds their weapon with two hands to raise their attack power. It was really freaking powerful. I leveled up everyone in the Knight class so they could unlock this skill, and in the end, everyone was two-handing their weapons.</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/norende.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>We've got a town to rebuild!</b></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>There is also some <strong>“town-building”</strong> in this game. A village is destroyed early on in the game and you are tasked with helping rebuild it. Residents of the town can be assigned to the reconstruction effort. The more residents you have, the faster the reconstruction happens. For example, to build the Item Shop, it would take 2 hours for one resident, 1 hour for two residents, and 30 minutes for three residents. As you build and expand shops, you get access to powerful items. You pick up a few residents automatically during the game, but every Streetpass tag you get adds another resident. Finally, my Spillpass-Pi (a Raspberry Pi that fetches you an inordinate amount of Streetpass tags) will see some more action! Another perk of playing the demo: you can transfer 20 residents over to the full game to get a nice boost in your future labor force!</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 20px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-10/pretty.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>The overworld (left) and the clock-inspired town of Ancheim (right).</b></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Even though the 3DS isn’t a <strong>graphics</strong> powerhouse, Bravely Default is pretty gorgeous considering. The overworld (that’s right - an old-school overworld) is vivid, lush, and covered in varied geographies. It feels like what Chrono Trigger would be if it was redone in 3D. Not only is the overworld good-looking, so are the towns. The town of Ancheim – featured in the demo – is designed like a clock with tons of winding gears and an antique feel. If you just stop and take it all in for a moment, the game even helps out by zooming out – allowing you to take in more of the scene. The <strong>music</strong> was composed by the Japanese musical group Revo, who also composed the awesome opening themes for Attack on Titan. In JRPGs, you’ll be listening to the battle theme a lot, so I’m happy to say this battle theme is definitely something I can listen to over and over again. Check out the theme below!</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: center">
<iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/grZA2ZrAdTU?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Even though this game is an homage to the olden days of Final Fantasy, it does include some <strong>quality-of-life improvements</strong> that address some typical JRPG complaints. Battle speed (the speed of the animations in battle) can be easily be toggled from super fast to a total pause. For trash mobs in dungeons, I always kept things at maximum speed because I had a good idea of how difficult the battle would be ahead of time. For bosses, I would slow things down to check out elemental affinities and other important battle-related metrics. The game also lets you change difficulty on-the-fly. If normal isn’t challenging enough, jump up to hard. If you realize you bit off more than you can chew, jump back down to normal (or even easy). No more restarting your entire game. And more than that can be toggled: battle encounter rate can be turned down to 0 or doubled, destination markers indicating where to go next can be disabled, and you can even turn off EXP/gold/job point gains after battles. If you’re into custom challenges, like low-level challenges, this game makes it surprisingly easy to fulfill your masochist tendencies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>February 7th can’t come fast enough.</strong> I’ll be spending my weekend digging into what looks to be another awesome JRPG addition to the 3DS.</p>

        May Jesus Be With Your Signage

    <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>Over the holidays I dropped by the Portuguese Consulate in Newark, NJ to take care of some top secret diplomatic business. An engineer by trade, I secretly harbor an anal-retentive designer in the depths of my heart. While waiting to take care of some important business, I peered over at the welcome signage and cried out in pain.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-06/typography.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>Hallelujah! Jesus-Christ-certified Identity Cards!</b></p>
</div>

<p>Jesus Christ! They spelled <strong>bilhetes</strong> with a Latin Cross (<strong>✝</strong>)! This was also the only occurrence of this most holy swap on the entire signage. I didn’t have the gall to ask the front desk what was up with the Jesus-infused character set. Was it a zealous designer subtly informing us that Catholicism is the dominant religion in Portugal? Maybe. I’d like to believe it was divine interven✝ion…</p>

<p>I used to be the kind of person that would find two or three decent restaurants and just visit them over and over again. In June, after another amazing meal at Panda Dumpling in San Carlos (read: not at all related to the chain Panda Express), I proudly <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/panda-dumpling-san-carlos#hrid:2JurJhZx-_Veom6ghp0VXA">penned</a> my first Yelp review. I’ve got a big appetite and a big mouth – After that first review, I realized I couldn’t just keep my opinions to myself. I also realized I was going to have to take some risks and explore what the wider food world had to offer if I expected to find more gems like Panda Dumpling.</p>

<p>Since then, it’s been a veritable firestorm of trying new places and writing more reviews. Here is an overview of my 2013 food findings!</p>

<!--break-->

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-01/5stars.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>From top left to bottom right: Shrimp and Eggs Chow Fun and Beef Lo Mein (Cafe Salina), Strawberry Peach Cobbler (Passionfish), Lion King (Cha Cha Sushi), Portuguese Roll and Pasteis de Nata (Teixeira's Bakery)</b></p>
</div>

<div class="space"></div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>5 Star Restaurants</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In 2013, I penned a whopping 208 Yelp reviews. I was pretty stingy when it came to giving out 5 star reviews, so you can be sure that the ones I DID award 5 stars completely knocked my socks off.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cha Cha Sushi</strong> (San Jose, CA) - Have you ever dreamed of a California Roll topped with salmon, tobiko, house sauce, and then baked to perfection? I have… And my dream came true. This sushi is far from authentic, but that’s not what it’s trying to be. If you ever dreamed of eating wonderfully delicious, hot, deep-fried sushi, you should visit Cha Cha Sushi. I could hype the crap out of this place and you’d probably still be blown away. Come with an open mind, and leave happy.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cafe Salina</strong> (Millbrae, CA) - A Hong Kong-style restaurant that has a ridiculously massive menu. I keep coming back and I’ve sampled a huge variety of dishes and have always been very impressed. Even the milkshakes are good! Try their Shrimp and Eggs Chow Fun if you want to try the dish that got me hooked. I also recommend coming in late in the evening (they close at midnight), as they seem to have some logistical issues getting dishes out in a timely manner during regular dining hours. The occasional slow service during peak hours is probably why their overall Yelp rating is not higher. Note that they also recently got a new chef, who customers seem to be impressed by.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Passionfish</strong> (Pacific Grove, CA) - A refined restaurant that leaves all that annoying (and unnecessary) snobbery at the door. From start to finish, this place was amazing. When dessert rolled around and I had the best cobbler (Strawberry Peach Cobbler) I’ve ever had, the 5-star deal was sealed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zadin</strong> (Mission, San Francisco, CA) - Sad to report that this restaurant closed its doors on December 19th. It’s too bad, because it’s a dream for people with dietary restrictions (e.g. vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free). I brought my sister here along with a larger group, and everyone had an equally wonderful meal.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Teixeira’s Bakery</strong> (Newark, NJ) - For their amazing Portuguese rolls, the location on Kossuth Street gets 5 stars. For the best pasteis de nata (custard cups) I’ve ever had, the Ferry Street location gets 5 stars. New Jersey isn’t as bad as all the haters make it out to be. I’m pretty sure they just never stopped by Teixeira’s Bakery.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-01/chinese.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>From top left to bottom right: Deep-Fried Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk (Champagne Restaurant), Shanghai Soup Dumplings and Chives Pancake (Panda Dumpling), Dan Dan Noodles (Yi Yuan), Sautéed Beef and Pumpkin and Cumin Lamb with Onions (China Palace)</b></p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Chinese Restaurants</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I ate a lot of Chinese food in 2013. Dim sum is one of my favorite cuisines, so I was always on the hunt for better and better dim sum. Here is the shortlist I give anyone who says they are craving Chinese food; Chinese food varies by region so this list attempts to cover different types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Panda Dumpling</strong> (San Carlos, CA) - Don’t be fooled by the gimmicky name. This place serves up the best Shanghai Soup Dumplings (xiao long bao) and Chives Pancake in the Bay Area.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Champagne Restaurant</strong> (Millbrae, CA) - The service here leaves something to be desired, but the food more than makes up for it. Champagne provides dim sum off a menu. My favorite is their Deep-Fried Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk. My girlfriend says these are second-best to the ones she’s had in China.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Yi Yuan Szechuan</strong> (Millbrae, CA) - For those looking for some spicy Szechuan-style cuisine, drop by this restaurant. Some dishes are incredibly spicy (Lanzhou Beef Ramen) but the menu doesn’t lie when it claims most dishes are “spicy but not numbing.” Check out their very popular Dan Dan Noodles.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cafe Salina</strong> (Millbrae, CA) - All the Chinese restaurants on this list are amazing, but only Cafe Salina earned 5 stars. In the list above, I write about why this place is so impressive.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>China Palace</strong> (Milpitas, CA) - Open so very, very late (3 AM), China Palace may be a bit out of the way, but if you’re craving good Chinese food at odd hours, there is hope. Even when I’ve rolled in around 2 AM this place has been packed. Notably, it was packed with mostly Chinese people, which is always a good indicator of how legitimate the food is!</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-01/bab.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>From top left to bottom right: Benedict a Trois (Town), Swiss and Mustard and Superlative Bread Pudding (The Refuge), Navaratan Korma (Amber India), French Burger with Brie (Cuisinett), Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (Good Mong Kok)</b></p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Bay Area Bites</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">There are some other restaurants that don't fit into the above two groups, but I'm always eager to recommend them as fine dining establishments.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Refuge</strong> (San Carlos, CA) - The Refuge specializes in thick, homemade pastrami and an impressive beer menu. Come hungry because appetizers will be amazing, entrees will be large and imposing, and you’ll need to save room for the best bread pudding around. Formerly called The Megatron, the bread pudding now goes by the more humble Superlative Bread Pudding. Same mouth-watering deliciousness, however.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Town</strong> (San Carlos, CA) - The priciest of the restaurants featured here, yet I never feel like I’m not getting my money’s worth. They have an awesome brunch menu (weekends only). Consider checking out the Benedict a Trois which gives you Eggs Benedict in three different styles: traditional ham, steak, and crab. I also love their Mom’s Meat Loaf Sandwich, which is pretty huge - even for my big mouth!</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>American Grill Cheese Kitchen</strong> (SOMA, San Francisco, CA) - Takes the classic American grilled cheese and ups the ante. All their sandwiches are worth a shot, but the Jalapeño Popper is my grilled cheese of choice. They also do gluten-free sandwiches. We’ve already scheduled it as a first stop for when my gluten-sensitive sister visits in the Spring.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cuisinett</strong> (San Carlos, CA) - Imagine a burger draped between two rich slabs of brie cheese. French. Comfort. Food. Also if you’re into wonderful fries, they have french fries sprinkled with truffle oil. Truly magical.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Amber India</strong> (Mountain View, CA) - My favorite Indian restaurant ever. The team at Amber India does so many things well; it always breaks my heart when I come for dinner and have to pick a few entrees instead of having access to their lunch buffet. My favorite dishes here are the Butter Chicken and Navaratan Korma.</li>
</ul>

<div class="space"></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Good Mong Kok Bakery</strong> (Chinatown, San Francisco, CA) - This past summer, some friends and I did a <a href="http://markcerqueira.com/2013/07/04/bbq-pork-bun-crawl---san-francisco/">BBQ Pork Bun Crawl in SF</a>. Since most bakeries served only baked pork buns, we compared each of the bakery’s baked buns to one another’s, and Victor’s edged out Good Mong Kok as the winner. But Good Mong Kok has an ace up its sleeve: it serves BOTH steamed and baked BBQ Pork Buns! Baked buns are great, but NOTHING beats an amazing steamed bun.</li>
</ul>
