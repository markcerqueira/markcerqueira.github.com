I watched about a metric ton (i.e. 18 series) of anime in 2013. I caught up on some of the hot series from previous seasons so most of the anime I watched I really, really enjoyed. Here's a breakdown ranging from must-watch series to skips:

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Your life isn't complete until you watch</strong></p>

* Toradora
* Welcome to the NHK

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Great - Definitely worth a watch</strong></p>

* Hataraku Maou-sama!
* Knights of Sidonia
* Madoka Magica
* Psycho-Pass
* Sword Art Online (Part 1)

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Good - worth watching if you like the genre</strong></p>

* Aldnoah Zero
* Kill la Kill
* Log Horizon
* No Game No Life
* Shingeki no Bahamut
* Sword Art Online 2

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Decent - would recommend these under specific circumstances</strong></p>

* Akame ga Kill!
* Angel Beats
* Psycho Pass 2
* Tokyo Ghoul
* Zankyou no Terror

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Skip - I wish I could forget I watched this</strong></p>

* Sword Art Online (Part 2)

That's a **rough** breakdown. I found myself moving stuff between the great and good group and just stopped after a while. Depending on your preferences some of these may be more or less appealing. Let me know if you have any questions or want to know my thoughts about any of these series.

On the horizon, I'm very pumped to watch the second season of Aldnoah Zero and Log Horizon!
