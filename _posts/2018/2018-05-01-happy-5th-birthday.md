Over the past year the reputation of the United States has taken several blows and fallen, but mark.gg continues to rise as an excellent place for all things amazing. Pumping out a post nearly every 5 days, the editorial team (of one) at mark.gg pumped out a blistering 66 posts in the previous year! Stupendous!

On a less serious note, the past year has been very busy: I got engaged, developed an insatiable addiction to [Magic][1] [the][2] [Gathering][3], [won a StarCraft 2 tournament][4], visited some new countries (🇬🇧🇳🇱🇩🇪), jumped back to the dark side and [did some iOS development][5], played a ton of ridiculously amazing games ([Nier Automata][6], [Breath of the Wild][7], [Xenoblade 2][8], and [Persona 5][9]), and have made a big (and somewhat scary but very exciting) career move into engineering management!

Here's to another exciting year! 🍻
