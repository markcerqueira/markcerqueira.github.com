In one of my proudest moments in my professional career, a coworker called me "the glue of the team." I'm a huge proponent of team member first, engineer second. Be a pleasure to work with first, output solid work after that. Amazing skills won't save you from being a terrible team player, but having the right attitude and contributing to a positive team atmosphere will undoubtely help create the environment you need to grow and succeed.

Get out there and be glue!
