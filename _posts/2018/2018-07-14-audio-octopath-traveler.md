Many people including myself have been looking forward to the quirkily named, classic JRPG-throwback Octopath Traveler. And now it's finally here!

There is plenty to rave about, but a pretty small detail early on in the game really impressed me. I started with Therion the Thief and during his opening story he meets someone in a large room in a mansion. 

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px; margin-bottom: 30px;" src="{{ site.images2018 }}/07-14/octopath-hall.jpg"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

The dialogue had reverberation! 😲

It's a small touch but it really shifted how I took in the entire scene. 👏👏👏 to caring about the small details; they do matter and sometimes make an outsized impact!
