I've been entangled with Xcode a bit recently and I've added to my arsenal a scratchpad in a simple text editor with just this text:

``#imageLiteral(resourceName: "name")``

Why? Once Xcode (9.2 currently) transforms that macro into an image it's impossible to get it back into a state where I can modify the image name by its name. Thanks, Xcode!
