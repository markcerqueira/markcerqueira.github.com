Things I never thought I'd say:

* The Nintendo Switch is the clear front-runner of this video game console generation.
* After pouring 100+ hours into Xenoblade Chronicles 2 I powered through a New Game+ playthrough.
* **Nintendo just graced me with a solid and thoughtful user experience.**

When the [Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon Kickstarter][1] delivered my Nintendo Switch download code, I fired up the eShop to redeem the code.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 1px; margin-top: 24px;" src="{{ site.images2018 }}/05-24/switchcode.jpg"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

Note that the characters for the letters `I`, `!`, and `O` are disabled, along with some other characters. This is a great user experience. No more confusion about whether the character is an `I` or a `1` or an `l` or a `!`. This eliminates the need to warn people when distributing codes and eliminates the need to warn people when they enter a code that is wrong because they swapped an `I` for a `1`.

In short: it's solid UX!
