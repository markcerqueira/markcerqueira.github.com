On this Valentine's Day, love is in the air! It's a great time to love, be loved, and think about your first love. Mine is easy: **Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars** for the Super Nintendo.

This was my first JRPG and I totally did not get it at first. I recall running through the first area, Mushroom Way, avoiding all the enemies and then when I faced off against the two Hammer Bros I just couldn't beat them. I kept doing this same strategy over and over again and eventually I did beat them and got to Mushroom Kingdom.

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Evil incarnate to my younger self.</strong></p>
</div>

But that same day my cousin overwrote my save file. **I literally cried.** My mom didn't understand what a save file was so no luck getting comfort there. 

After tears were wiped away I started over. But this time instead of avoiding all those enemies in Mushroom Way I got the bright idea to fight all of them. I got experience points, I levelled up, I got more powerful, and I crushed the Hammer Bros. Like Columbus discovered America, **I had discovered grinding**.

I would go on to complete and fall in love with Super Mario RPG. I didn't know at the time, but not only had I found an amazing game, I also found an amazing genre I'm still in love with to this day.

Happy Valentine's Day!

P.S. Super Mario RPG has an [amazing ending theme][1].
