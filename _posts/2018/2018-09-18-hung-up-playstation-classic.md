Sony's announcement today that it was joining Nintendo in making classic versions of its former consoles is exciting for those who never had a chance to explore the awesome games of that generation and exciting for those who are craving a nostalgia trip. Everyone's a winner, right?

Wrong. I'm massively hung up on the PlayStation Classic because of the [reveal video][1]. On video start, I immediately muted the Apple-esque hipster music but little did I know the worst was yet to come. Within the next few seconds there was a transgression to common sense.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 480px; border: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="{{ site.images2018 }}/09-18/ps-classic.gif"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.0em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

There is **so much wrong** in these few seconds. The size comparison text glitches in and starts at "99% smaller than the original PlayStation" and then works its way down to "45% smaller than the original PlayStation." Imagine walking into a store and someone tells you everything is 99% off but when you get to the register everything is only 45% off. That's a raw deal: you don't show someone a more impressive number and then lower it right in front of them. This is a reveal video, not New Year's; not everything should count down.

If that's not enough, the size of the PlayStation Classic inside the original PlayStation is going from physically bigger (0% smaller compared to the original) to physically smaller (45% smaller compared to the original). This is the inverse of the non-sensical countdown above.

Me after watching this reveal video: ðŸ˜µ.
