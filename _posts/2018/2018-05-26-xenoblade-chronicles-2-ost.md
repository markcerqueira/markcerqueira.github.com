This past Wednesday we got another treat from our benevolent Monolith Soft overlords: the official soundtrack to **Xenoblade Chronicles 2**! Finally! Waiting six months after the game came out to have the music in my library has been unbearable! A month before this release, we even got a wonderful illustration for the soundtrack from a character designer for the game:

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

It took a few days to listen to the entire soundtrack as it's a staggering 105 tracks clocking in at nearly five and half hours, but this soundtrack is pure gold.

How good is it? On Google Play Music I only grace songs with a thumbs up when I want it to on my "This playlist gets no skips" playlist and... **42 out of 105 songs** have a "won't ever skip this song" thumbs up!

Four composers -- the legendary Yasunori Mitsuda, the magical cool-capitalization trio composing group ACE (TOMOri KUDO, CHiCO), Kenji Hiramatsu, Manami Kiyota -- make the soundtrack a journey through changing times, different places, and a gamut of emotions. The soundtrack has intense rock songs like [Counterattack][3], emotionally moving songs like [Contrition][2], a beautiful vocal ending theme in [One Last You][4], and even something you'd maybe hear in a church with [Our Eternal Land][5].

One of the things I appreciated most about this soundtrack was it became available worldwide digitally on the release date. No need to order a physical copy from Japan or attempt to trick the Japanese iTunes Store into letting me purchase it with a US-based billing address. I picked up my digital copy on [Amazon Music][1]. Balking at the $39.99 price tag? It's worth it. Trust me.
