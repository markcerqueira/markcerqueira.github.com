I just wrapped up my first power-up-managerial-skills book: **Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work** by Chip and Dan Heath.

**Who recommended the book?** This book was recommended by someone on the Twitch Manager Book Club. A gaggle of managers come together and talk about a book: what they liked, what they found most helpful, what surprised them, etc. Then we close by getting someone to recommend another book. It's a great motivator to power through books and great for discovering new books to read.

**Judge the book by its cover, font, page quality?** Decisive is a sturdy hardcover book with a corrosive green book jacket that features a magic 8-ball. It's a clever play for a book about making decisions. Going jacketless gives you a simple, black matte cover with shiny corrosive green text on the spine. I went jacketless. The paper inside the book is thick, I loved it. The font choice is nice and there is a comfortable amount of leading. All in all, great first impression.

**Thoughts on the book and the big take-aways?** Decisive is a well-written, entertaining, memorable, and informative read. The book revolves around the WRAP process which helps us navigate the complexities of decision making.

* **W**iden your options
* **R**eality-test your assumptions
* **A**ttain distance before deciding
* **P**repare to be wrong

For each of these steps the book covers a few strategies that can help you. For example, when preparing to be wrong, it's helpful to set a tripwire to help us realize we have a decision to make; oftentimes on autopilot we totally miss the opportunity to pivot when things aren't going well.

While this is helpful, the real magic of the book is in the many real-world anecdotes that illustrate how these strategies were (or were not) used in the past to achieve success (or failure). For example, Kodak didn't take the growing threat of digital photography seriously enough because it did not set a tripwire to help them realize they had an important decision to make. The anecdotes are interesting and ground the strategies as realistic and valuable.

Ultimately the book provides pithy strategies and advice which gives me confidence I will remember them and hopefully be able to identify and leverage them when the time comes. 

**Notes in Evernote?** This book has a great feature I wish more books in this genre did: one-pagers at the end of every chapter that captures the big takeways. My notes are mostly just a transcription of those with some quotes that really stuck out to me. Feel free to review [my notes][1] on üêò.
