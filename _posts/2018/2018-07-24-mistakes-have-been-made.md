I have made two notable mistakes recently. 

1. I thought the third season of **Boku no Hero Academia** was a single cour. With anime I normally wait for the entire season to finish and then binge watch it. Mistakes were made because the third season is actually two cours. On the bright side, I am now a proud citizen of the UNITED STATES OF SMASH!

2. A friend on Facebook posted about yet another remake of the Hana Yori Dango manga: **Meteor Garden**. I told Tina about it, Tina watched some episodes, Tina got addicted to it, I watched some episodes, and now I'm addicted to it. The six episodes Netflix is releasing weekly is great but is no panacea for the Meteor Fever we are now afflicted with.

**Mistakes have been made but I have no regrets... And that has made all the difference.**
