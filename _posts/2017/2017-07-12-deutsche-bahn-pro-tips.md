Having recently completed a journey from Amsterdam to Munich via the Deutsche Bahn here are two pro tips for those considering taking the train:

* Reserve your seats ahead of time. We bought tickets without reserving seats and finding empty, non-reserved seats on the train was an exercise in frustration. 
* If you stop in Cologne, the train may go out in the direction it came. Don't worry, the train isn't going back the way you came! This will hopefully save you a freak out like the one I had while in the train bathroom. 

Safe travels!
