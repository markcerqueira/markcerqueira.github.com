I’ve never seen my grandma use a recipe. I’ve never seen her use a timer. I’ve never seen her ask for advice on how to improve a dish. And most importantly — given all this — I’ve never tasted one of her creations that was off.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2017-01-06/grandma.jpg"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Cooking some rebanadas!</strong></p>
</div>

But we all can’t be my grandma. Whereas my grandma makes cooking look like an art, conjuring divine inspiration and direction from thin air, I take a more scientific approach to cooking. Things are measured carefully and precisely, timers are used all the time, and recipes are annotated to remove any and all ambiguity.

So that’s why I don’t print out recipes or keep a list of bookmarked recipes; I use the [Evernote Web Clipper][1] to clip recipes directly into Evernote. Then when I use those recipes, I add observations (e.g. different flour brands affect the density of bread), critical reminders (e.g. don’t forget to set the oven temperature down), tweaks (e.g. add a little more flour to get less sticky dough), and fun facts (e.g. which maple syrup Canadians prefer). Here are some examples:

* [Pão de queijo (Brazilian cheesy bread)][2]
* [Whole wheat bread for a bread machine][3]
* [Stuffed shells][4]

This method lets each recipe evolve every time I use it. I can also easily share them with others as seen above. Ultimately, I aim to be about 10% as good as my grandma which is a stretch goal to be honest.
