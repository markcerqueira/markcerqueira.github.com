The Twitter reply experience on the web is incredibly awful. Click reply on a Tweet and you'll see something like this:

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 1px;" src="{{ site.images2017 }}/08-30/delete.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Click in the red and your reply is dead!</strong></p>
</div>

I enhanced this screenshot to point out what's terrible: **if you click anywhere in the red area the reply window goes away and takes your reply with it to the grave**.

You're probably thinking they cache the tweet somewhere and when you click on the reply button again it brings it back. **Wrong!** Your cleverly crafted reply is permanently dead. So you type it again trying to make it as great as its now deceased predeccesor or lose that last meager ounce of faith you had in Twitter and leave.
