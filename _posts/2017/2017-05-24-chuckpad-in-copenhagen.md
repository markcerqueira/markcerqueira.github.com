[ChuckPad][1] went to Copenhagen! Last week, Spencer and I attended the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference at Aalborg University in Copenhagen and showed off ChuckPad to other conference attendees. We got the opportunity to hang out with old friends, make new ones, and check out cool stuff other people are working on around the world.

While in Copenhagen I also got to do plenty of sight-seeing. Copenhagen, as I see it, in a nutshell: lots of beer, lots of water, lots of sunlight (there was sunlight from 4 AM to 10 PM), and lots of bicycles! All in all, a great time!
