Inundated by notifications on my phone, a month ago I started aggressively long-pressing notifications and disabling all but the ones I find truly important (e.g. text message from girlfriend, MCanning going live on Twitch). Why? Most things I was getting notified about weren't super critical and could wait to be addressed, but notifications don't wait. They grab your attention immediately and beg for some action that  pulls you away from whatever you are doing. A former classmate has a much more well-thought out post on why we should be fighting against [Death By Notification][1].

A month into this experiment I find myself checking my phone a lot less frequently and visiting social media mall a lot less. I don't plan to re-enable any notifications.
