I just wrapped up another "catch-up session" on anime. I picked a few shows: some new and some sequels to stuff I've watched and powered through them. I got through four shows and lucked out as I enjoyed all of them. 

* **Mob Pscyho 100** - This was the most popular show of the season and it's hard not too love since it's packed with the perfect amount of action and humor. It's written by the same author as One Punch Man and it's somewhat similar in that it has a protagonist that's stupidly overpowered. The [opening theme][1] is also cool because it teaches you how to count from 1 to 100.

* **ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept.** - Madhouse does it again! The show is basically a bureacrat travelling to different states of a country to do inspections of their local government offices. Sounds boring and it's not action-packed but the story manages to hook you in. This is definitely the most "non-traditional" show I watched but I highly recommend it. [You can't go wrong a Madhouse anime.][2]

* **Dan Machi: Sword Oratoria** - Sword Oratoria is the sidequel to the first season of Dan Machi and shows us that story through the eyes of Ais Wallenstein and the Loki Familia. Overlord and Log Horizon are still at the top of my "video game anime" list but Dan Machi delivers story and action that kept me rolling from one episode to another. 

* **Attack on Titan Season 2** - Attack on Titan is massively popular but my major gripe with it is that it continues to pile on questions while offering very few answers. After watching the first season a few years back I read the manga because I wanted to get some answers but even then no answers had been provided. Only recently did the manga start bringing things together and season 2 of the anime was unable to clear up some of the mysteries in the Attack on Titan world. It's crazy, it's bloody, it's intense, and it's fun to watch but don't expect this season to answer any burning questions.

I enjoy powering through anime instead of watching an episode a week, so next up will definitely be Boku no Hero Academia season 2 because the first season was so good!
