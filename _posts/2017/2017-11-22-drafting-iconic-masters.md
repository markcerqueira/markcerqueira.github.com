We've been drafting Ixalan a lot lately at Twitch. To spice things up we did a Kaladesh + Aether Revolt draft last week and this week we threw down to do an Iconic Masters draft.

Drafting Iconic Masters was a ton of fun. I packed a **Sheoldred, Whispering One** so I did something pretty unconventional and kept picking cool black cards. When I didn't see any good black cards I started splashing white because the heart of the cards told me to. Both colors must've been pretty open because I was passed a **Blood Baron of Vizkopa** and an **Emeria Angela**. Getting an **Indulgent Tormenter** towards the end of the draft strengthened my belief in the heart of the cards once again.

The deck played great -- naturally -- if I could survive to get Indulgent Tormenter and then Sheoldred out. Getting more cards and having my opponent sacrifice their creatures every turn is pretty awesome! üòè

Iconic Masters was a really fun set to draft because it packs a ton of [cool, beautiful cards][1]. The price point ($30 versus the usual $7.50) pushes it out of the "every week draft" category but it's certainly a special treat one should try at least once!
