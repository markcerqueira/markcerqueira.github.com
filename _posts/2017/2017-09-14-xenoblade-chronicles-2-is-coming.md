This is the level of faith I have in Monolith Soft and the power of Xenoblade: I picked up a Wii U for Xenoblade Chronicles X and am soon picking up a Switch now that the release date for Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (XC2) has been revealed. **December 1st** can't come soon enough!

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

Unlike Xenoblade Chronicle 2's release date announcement [nearly six months out][1], I'll only need to languish for under three months before I can get my hands on this! I'm super excited to be able to play XC2 on-the-go especially since I'll be flying back east for the holidays. Both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X were great games, but in somewhat different ways; I'm excited to see where XC2 sits in between the two great gems that preceeded it.
