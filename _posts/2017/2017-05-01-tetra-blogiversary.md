It's the first of May again! Today I celebrate the birthday of my amazing friend Josh Wu who I married... to his wife, and four years of blogging on mark.gg! **52 posts** were published so I just eeked out last year's resolution of one post per week but definitely came up short on the aggressive resolution of 1.5 posts per week. The past year has been an exciting year as I changed jobs from [Evernote to Twitch][1], am learning [Chinese][3], and will be going to [Copenhagen][2] to present ChuckPad at New Interfaces for Musical Expression 2017. Here's to another exciting one!
