There are three books in N.K. Jemisin's fabulous The Broken Earth trilogy. Reviews calling the series [a triumphant achievement in fantasy literature][1] are not exaggerating how amazing the series is. I slammed away a book a week because it was difficult to put down this series. If you're looking for a health blend of sci-fi, adventure, mystery, and sociology check out this series! Major kudos to Jemisin for crafting this masterpiece!
