I participated in my first Chinese speech contest today! I participated in the second semester college division for people with no prior experience with Mandarin.

My speech was a made-up story about my family visiting me from Portugal and us sight-seeing in San Francisco. There we ran into a Portuguese girl who could not speak English and didn't know where her family was. We helped her find her family but first went to eat Chinese food which let me flex the strongest aspect of my Chinese vocabulary! 

<blockquote>
在中國餐廳，我們吃了叉燒包，葱油饼，水餃，和小籠包。我們又喝了珍珠奶茶。只有我爸爸喝啤酒，因為我的爸爸不喜歡喝茶。<br>

Zài Zhōngguó cāntīng, wǒmen chīle chāshāo bāo, cōng yóubǐng, shuǐjiǎo, hé xiǎo lóng bāo. Wǒmen hái hēle zhēnzhū nǎichá. Zhǐyǒu wǒ bàba hē píjiǔ, yīnwèi wǒ de bàba bù xǐhuan hē chá.

It was a nervewracking experience, but it went well and I ended up getting Honorable Mention! 很好！
