It's already been a month since I joined the Twitch family and I'm happy to announce you can already enjoy the fruits of my labor on [Twitch's Android app][1]. You can now view Clips by broadcaster! I think this feature is particularly cool because:

* Clips are mobile-friendly since they're short. You can plow through a bunch of clips in a few minutes.
* I watch a lot of StarCraft 2 streams but I definitely have a list of go-to broadcasters (e.g. MCanning).
* I built it.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 1px;" src="{{ site.images2017 }}/05-04/clips.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Clips by MCanning</strong></p>
</div>

And that's only the beginning! I'm busy working on other stuff and excited to make the Twitch experience on Android even better. Stay tuned!
