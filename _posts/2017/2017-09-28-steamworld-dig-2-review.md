The core gameplay loop of SteamWorld Dig 2 is pretty simple: go into mines, dig your way down, collect ores and gems, sell said items, and power yourself up to make this entire process faster and easier. It's a simple formula, but it's very well-executed making a fun and addicting game. Way past my bedtime I found myself playing for "only 5 more minutes" far too many times!

While SteamWorld Dig 2 is available on many platforms, I really enjoyed playing it on the Nintendo Switch. The screen is large (edges out the Vita) and playing for bits at time when on-the-go worked well with the style of the game. The only downside to the Switch is I can't get any [sweet trophies][1] to show off my achievements, but I'm hoping Nintendo gets with the times and finishes getting its services infrastructure to PS3 and Xbox 360 levels this generation!

Anyhow, don't hesisate! Go grab SteamWorld Dig 2 and settle in to **dig into** some fun, engaging, and **really, really deep** gameplay. üòè
