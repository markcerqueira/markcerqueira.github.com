Great news! [ChuckPad][1] was selected the be published in this year's New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) proceedings! This year's conference will be held at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, Denmark so Spencer and I will be making the trip out to present ChuckPad to the greater computer music community. It'll be a great opportunity to catch up with laptop orchestra friends, see a new country, eat good food, and drink excellent beer.
