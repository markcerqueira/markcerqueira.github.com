It's been a three-month journey, but today, I (slowly) said goodbye to a dear friend. 

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-02/beard.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

My college professor and -- more importantly -- a man with some greats ideas, [Perry Cook][2], recommended I run this ~~photo of mass destruction~~ work of art through Microsoft's [How Old Robot][1].

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-02/old-t.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

Besides being 10 years off from my actual age, what have we learned about the robot? To be young is to have no facial hair. Full beards make you a bit older. Handlebar mustaches make you look even older (and badass of course). But nothing compares to the aging power of a mean mustache!

Adieu, friend!
