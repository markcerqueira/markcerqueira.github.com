One year ago I celebrated [my first blogiversary][1]. And now -- one year later -- here we are at the two year blogiversary! It was a busy year for the blog with **58 posts written** and over **13 thousand pageviews**!

It's also been a busy year in general. I [**joined Evernote**][2] in November -- that's HALF A YEAR ago! And the fun doesn't stop: I'll be heading off to **Japan for a month** this week and will be visiting family in **Portugal in July**. 

Goals for this coming year include writing more, working on some open source projects, and trying to get another paper published so I can enhance my [Google Scholar page][3].

See you again in May 2016 for another (short and somewhat vain) year-in-review!
