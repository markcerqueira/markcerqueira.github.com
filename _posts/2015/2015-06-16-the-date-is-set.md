The day will be **December 4th, 2015**. The sadness of not knowing when **Xenoblade Chronicles X** is coming to North America is over. It has been replaced by both sadness and anticipation that it's a little under half a year away. 

There were a lot of exciting announcements at this year's E3, but a release date out of the Nintendo and Monolith Soft camp is all I wanted. We even got another trailer that features those iconic Hiroyuki Sawano-esque vocals right when you have robots epically gliding over water!

**Xenoblade X is out now! Rejoice!**
