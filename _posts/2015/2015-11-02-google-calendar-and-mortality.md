Do seemingly random things ever hit unexpected places in unexpected ways?

I have a Birthday calendar that I use to keep track of family and friend’s birthdays. It’s reliable because:

* Birthdays don’t (normally) change!
* I don’t have to rely on some social network (and proper privacy settings) to inform me.
* I can add reminders days or weeks ahead of particular birthdays in case I need to get a gift.

Adding someone’s birthday to my calendar is easy. You create a new event and set it to repeat annually. And then the unexpected part happens:

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #555555;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-11-02/repeating.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>I go with the DENIAL route and pick NEVER.</strong></p>
</div>

Wow! Google Calendar just reminded me of a sobering and morbid truth: **everyone dies**. Thanks for that! And double thanks for reminding me of that when I’m thinking about people important enough to be added to my special Birthday calendar.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #555555;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-11-02/feels.gif"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>This calendar hit me right in the feels!</strong></p>
</div>

Feeling down? Turn that frown around! It's Monday! Happy Monday! Be happy please! Come on!
