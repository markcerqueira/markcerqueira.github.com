The army-of-one mark.gg team is proud to announce that the [Archive][1] page is now massively improved! Posts were previously sorted chronologically, but now they're sorted by subject matter. Now, you can quickly reach the 8 posts I've written on [Final Fantasy][2], 13 posts on all things [Android][3], and -- something I'm **very proud** of -- 22 [rant][4] posts!

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>So many tags!!</strong></p>
</div>

Huge kudos to [Michael Lanyon][6] who crafted a great and easy-to-follow [write-up][5] on adding tags to your Jekyll-powered blog. Thanks, dude!

Do visit the new and improved [Archive][1] page and bask in the randomness of topics I write about!
