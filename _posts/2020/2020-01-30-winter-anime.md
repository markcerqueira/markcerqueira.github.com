It's that time again yet again... Time to plow through some anime! As always featuring my quick thoughts and a GIF!

**Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba** - The runaway hit of Fall 2019 naturally did not disappoint. This show is fantastic: the story, the characters, the animation, and the music are all very, very well done. What did get a bit annoying after a while was how much Zenitsu and Inosuke yell; once they're introduced the amount of yelling in the show goes up noticeably for no good reason.

**My Hero Academia - Season 4** - As Deku settles into being able to control One for All this series has been able up the ante with its two recent seasons. This season is still ongoing but it's certified solid from what's come out so far. I enjoyed the shift in focus from Class 1-A to Deku and the Big 3 of UA especially Mirio. Last season had an epic fight between All Might and All For One; I thought that fight couldn't be trumped in epicness but this season delivered! Also, after four seasons it's truly weird that villains are so willing to kill but heroes would never consider it; then again, this is shonen anime.

**Sword Art Online - Alicization: War of the Underworld** - The previous season of the Alicization arc was great and laid down solid groundwork that War of the Underworld has capatilized on. The season quickly jumps into introducing a new baddie and even makes the Dark Territory more nuanced than it sounds. There is a smidge of the chronic problem plaguing Sword Art Online, the Kirito harem, but overall I enjoyed this season. At only twelve episodes it felt like this season wasn't able to cover much and I can't wait for the next season that's coming out in April 2020.

**Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? - Season 2** - This was a fun watch but not mind-blowing. What I liked about this season: it had an Episode 0 that caught us up on the previous season's happenings; this is a great idea that I wish more animes would do. This twelve episode seasons had three mini arcs with unbalanced pacing that left only two episodes for the last arc. That said, if you're into the isekai genre DanMachi is a worthwhile watch.

**Dr. Stone** - This was a very, very fun watch! The premise is simple: every living thing is turned to stone and thousands of years later some humans start turning back to normal. One of them, Senku, is a genius and wants to jumpstart civilization with the power of science! I knew science was fun but this show delivered that and then some! I was impressed with seamless transition from the opening arc with Taiku to the village arc with Chrome, but maybe it's because both look pretty similar and filled the role of bumbling sidekick. I can't wait for the next season of this show. 

There's always more to watch (e.g. Attack on Titan Season 3, Vinland Saga) but as usual, it'll have to wait for next time! ðŸ‘‹
