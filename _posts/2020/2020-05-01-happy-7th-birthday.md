As I approach the ten year anniversary of my move from New Jersey to California to begin my career, today marks seven years of blogging on mark.gg!

My first post on [Android Annotations, Ant, Dalvik Executable (dex)][1] feels like forever ago. The Android ecosystem has evolved so much since then: Kotlin has become a first-class Android programming language, Apache Ant has been replaced by Gradle, Android Runtime (ART) has supplanted Dalvik, and most of the great stuff provided by Android Annotations is now built into the default Android development experience.

2020 here we come!
