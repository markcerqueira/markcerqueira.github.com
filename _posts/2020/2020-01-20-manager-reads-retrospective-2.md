This retrospective is long overdue given I did the [first Manager Reads retrospective][1] after four books and have now covered twenty books in the Manager Reads series.

* **Has reading these books been worthwhile?** Yes! Reading books on management won't instantly make you a good manager but they have certainly have contributed to my success and working through the challenges in the role. Like [good QA being a puzzle][2] being a great manager requires a multi-faceted approach; disdain for this category of books because they are not silver bullets is misplaced.

* **What's been so worthwhile?** The most helpful thing I get from reading these books is frameworks for approaching management and the language used to discuss these frameworks, the problems they are trying to solve, and the solutions proposed. For example, the crux of [Turn the Ship Around!][3] is leaders should divest control to create leadership at every level of their team. To successfully divest control the team must have both competence and clarity. This framework that shifts which shifts the team from the leader-follower model to the leader-leader model has been something I try to leverage as much as possible.

* **Favorite book so far?** It's hard to pick just one so here are my three favorites: [Extreme Ownership][4], [Turn the Ship Around][3], and [Orbiting the Giant Hairball][5]. I can't recommend all three enough; they're fantastic reads!

* **Least liked book so far?** While the [The Effective Manager][6] offered some helpful tips the book felt too prescriptive and ultimately very bland. Also, the cover doesn't really make sense to me. 

* **Will you continue reading?** Absolutely! The more I dig in the more I find other great books to read. The only thing I want to change is to do a better job mixing in other types of books (e.g. science fiction, fantasy) that I can read purely for fun.
