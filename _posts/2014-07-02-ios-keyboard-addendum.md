A few weeks ago, I wrote a [post](2014/06/10/ios-keyboard-woes/) pointing out (i.e. complaining about) how iOS 7 broke the keyboard's shift key. A coworker pointed out that the shift key really didn't break in iOS 7 (released September 2013), but rather in iOS 7.1 (released March 2014). Android aside, I think iOS 6 still has the best shift key, but iOS 7.0's shift key at least makes some sense. Here is a more complete picture depicting the shift key's deterioration.

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The descent into madness...</strong></p>
</div>

I can't wait to see how much "better" they make the shift key in iOS 8!
