A week after its release, I beat **Star Ocean Integrity and Faithlessness** a.k.a. Star Ocean 5. Here are some of my thoughts on the game.

* The game is **short**: I beat it in 24 hours doing about 70% of the side quests.
* The **story** is pretty poor. It's easily the weakest in the series.
* I liked the cast of **characters** and the voice-acting was pretty good! Each character was unique and memorable. The story didn't do the characters enough justice but the optional Private Actions gave some opportunities for development.
* The battle system is good, but the **AI was terrible** at making all characters useful. Heal spells always seemed to be improperly timed!
* How **cutscenes** were implemented was lazy and really hurt the delivery of the already-bad story. Cutscenes were rendered without any special handling and would let the player walk around and control the camera. This likely saved a lot of development time as cutscenes did not need to be "directed" but really cheapened each scene. 
* The **camera** was bad: too close to the character and too jarring when moving around.
* There was too much **backtracking** without early fast travel options.
* The option to have orchestrated **battle music** from Valkyrie Profile was great! This reminded me how much I want Valkyrie Profile 3 to happen.

**Conclusion:** it's the weakest entry in the series so far. Even though I just finished trashing the game pretty hard, I powered through it because it was fun to play (I'm a masochist). Along with the Tales series I always considered Star Ocean to be a reliable source for decent JRPGs. This game sadly makes me question that. **I would not recommend buying the game at the $60 price-tag, but if you find this game in the bargain bin, I'd recommend picking it up if you're hungry for a JRPG.**
