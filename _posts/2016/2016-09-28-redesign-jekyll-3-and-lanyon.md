When I first started this blog in 2013, I stringed it together with a very basic understanding of Jekyll, HTML, CSS, and a bunch of other acronyms I don't fully understand. Like any well-engineered system, I didn't know all the internal details but kept adding to the magnificence of it. 

A few years later, I tried upgrading from Jekyll version 2 to 3 a few times and always ran into deal-breaking issues.

In early August I finally bit the bullet all the way and upgraded to Jekyll 3 and updated the theme of the blog to use the popular [Lanyon][2] theme. The upgrade to Jekyll 3 let me go back to simply publishing my blog by pushing new commits to GitHub and the Lanyon theme let me cut a large amount of bootstrapping files from my codebase.

There were a few issues to iron out along the way but now, the blog now feels leaner and meaner. It's a little heavy but feel free to [check out the commit][1] that made this transition happen.

Happy blogging!
