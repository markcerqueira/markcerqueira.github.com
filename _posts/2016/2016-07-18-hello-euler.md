Last Thursday I was browsing a coworker's repositories on GitHub and noticed one inconspicuously called **euler**. And that's how I discovered [Project Euler][1]! The website describes the project as "a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve."

I wouldn't describe myself as a math aficionado, but have had a blast working my way through the problems. So far, I have already picked up a lot about prime numbers and touched the ceilings of number-based data structures many times! With over 500 problems (and a new one every week), I'll be able to keep myself occupied for a while. 

Like my coworker I now too have an [euler repository][2] that you can browse.
