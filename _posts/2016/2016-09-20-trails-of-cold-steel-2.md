A few weeks ago I wrapped up playing the awesome [Trails of Cold Steel][1]. Fortunately for me the sequel came out a few days later. I'm deep into Trails of Cold Steel 2 and man... what a game! The first entry spent a lot of time building out the world and characters and the sequel is capitalizing on all that groundwork.

Reviews of Trails of Cold Steel 2 say this entry wraps up most of the many loose ends from the first entry which is something I'm really looking forward to. Everything great from the first game is still here with a few tweaks to make the experience fresh and new. Also, the music is still freaking amazing!

If you're looking for a solid JRPG experience now is a great time to drop into the Trails of Cold Steel duology.
