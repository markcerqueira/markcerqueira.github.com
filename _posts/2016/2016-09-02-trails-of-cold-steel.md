I just wrapped up **Legends of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel** on the Vita. It's a JRPG set in the Legends of Heroes world, focuses on a class of students at a military academy, and guides us through their field studies around the empire as they learn about brewing troubles. The game is like **Grandia** with a turn-based and position-based battle system; **Persona** with lots of focus on character development and relationship building; **Final Fantasy 7** with a materia-esque system for powering up your team; and **Xenoblade Chronicles** because it has a ridiculously amazing soundtrack.

This game is a solid 40 hours of world-building for the first entry of a three-part series. The plot is delicately and intricately laid out and the game ends on a **massive cliffhanger**. This game is not for those who want a straightforward plot or a self-contained story that resolves itself by the end. While the gameplay and battle system is enough to warrant a play-through, you'll likely be craving the next entry by the time the game wraps up.

Lucky for me, the sequel, Trails of Cold Steel 2, comes out next Tuesday!
