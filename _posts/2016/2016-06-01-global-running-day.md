Today is [Global Running Day][1]. I'm a huge fan of running. My four mile runs every weekday wake me up physically (and mentally) and are the cornerstone to a great day.

I started running in college to get in better shape. I ran pretty slowly and got injured pretty quickly into my journey. Today I'm much healthier, run a little faster, can cover longer distances, and get injured less often. Post-running ice packs are a godsend! Not running feels strange now and makes me very uneasy.

If you've ever considered running as an exercise, I highly recommend you give it a shot. It's changed my life in so many wonderful ways. And you don't need to run fast; just run at a pace that doesn't kill you. Before you know it, you'll be running faster and longer distances. And soon thereafter, you'll be hooked and call yourself a runner.
