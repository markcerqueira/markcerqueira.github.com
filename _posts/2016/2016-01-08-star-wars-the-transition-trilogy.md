**SPOILER ALERT:** Skip this post if you haven't watched Star Wars: The Force Awakens. 

The first Star Wars episodes released -- 4 through 6 -- are collectively referred to as the **original trilogy**. Episodes 1 through 3, which predate the events in the original trilogy, comprise the **prequel trilogy**.

After watching The Force Awakens, I think we are in the midst of the **transition trilogy**. The general theme of the transition trilogy? See old talent out the door as new talented is ushered in. Han kicked the bucket in episode 7. I predict Luke and Leia are in for unfortunate times in the next two episodes.

Transitions... They happen sometimes.
