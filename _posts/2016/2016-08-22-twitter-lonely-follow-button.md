The Follow button on Twitter feels strangely out of place. The left side of the page has the Tweet to and Message actions. I tend to look there when I want to follow someone. But the Follow button is all the way on the right.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2016-08-22/follow.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Hanging out all the way on the right...</strong></p>
</div>

It's above the Who to follow section which kind of makes sense. I'm unsure if the current three column separation is ideal. Perhaps a two column version where the Follow button and Who to follow section is integrated into the leftmost column would be nice, but I can see why Twitter would want to jam-pack as much stuff as possible above the fold.
