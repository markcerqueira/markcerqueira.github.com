If you write some code and want to share it with the world, **don't forget to add a license**! Posting code on a public repository on GitHub and allowing people to incorporate that code into their own products are not one and the same. So add a license please!

As will all things, there are tons of licenses for you to pick from. [choosealicense.com][2] has a nice [guide][1] on the most commonly used licenses. Basically, if you want to let people use your code without too many restrictions go with the **MIT License**.

So go forth! Code, slap a license on it, and share it!
