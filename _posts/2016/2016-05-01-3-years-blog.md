Today is the three year celebration of the mark.gg blog. In the past year I was a bit of a slacker so only **35 posts** were published. Over **10,000 people** visited the blog racking up over **14,000 pageviews**!

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Pageviews for the last year</strong></p>
</div>

Bloggiversary resolution: one post per week. Aggressive resolution: 1.5 posts per week. Catch you in May 2017 for another mark.gg status update!
