I **used** to be really fat. At my worst, I weighed 255 pounds and my doctor was telling me I should do something about my high cholesterol and high blood pressure -- an indirect way of telling me I'm a fat ass. And then I did something about it. Today, I've lost a third of my former self, have the blood pressure of an athlete, and my doctor can finally stop looking for medical euphemisms for "fat ass."

I don't have some secret diet or exercise plan. I just started **eating less, moving more, and lifting heavy things**. Progress is slow and takes time; **nothing magical will happen overnight** or even over a month. Weight loss is a never-ending journey: I've reached my goals, but continue to remain vigilant about my health because I absolutely refuse to go back. For the first time ever I feel comfortable in my own skin, and I only want to get stronger. I'm challenging myself to run longer and faster, to improve my kendo, and to lift heavier. In short, **it feels good**, so I'm going to keep being healthy.
