Visiting home, where Portuguese is the dominant language, I am constantly reminded of my deteriorating command of my native tongue. Yet today, I realized that there are words my Portuguese-American family uses that would probably leave my relatives living in Portugal pretty perplexed. These are bastard words: born out of an unholy union between English and Portuguese. I bet most Luso-Americans will know what these words mean, but most Portuguese people will just give you strange looks if you drop one of these gems around them. Here is a small (and very casual) ethnographic look at some uniquely Portuglish words. 

**liquostore** - Portuguese people love their libations, yet the proper translation of liquor store is *loja de bebidas*. There are far too many syllables there, so let's just go with liquostore. 

**sneaka** - Sounds a lot like sneaker and that's exactly what a Luso-American might call them instead of the proper *sapatilhas* or *t√©nis*.

**zinko** - This morphing of sink reminds me of transliterated Japanese words that often end in a vowel. You have a sink? A Luso-American has a zinko (zink-koo). A Portuguese person has a *pia*.

**parquear** - Interestingly enough, this was the only verb I could come up with. Used instead of the proper *estacionar*, this word means "to park a car."

**estoa** - This word takes "store" and adds some more vowels to it. The proper Portuguese word for store is *loja*.

These were the ones that I could come up with, but I'm sure there are more. If you know any, [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira)!
