Today, I got a cold call from a recruiter: Jeff. I gave him my usual response to recruiters, "Sorry. I'm happy at Smule. If things change, I'll reach out to you." Yet, Jeff deserved a little more than this. After all, he somehow dug up my phone number. My interest piqued, I naturally asked Jeff how he got my number. Jeff proudly said, "**Our Research Department**. For candidates we are highly interested in, **Our Research Department** gets their info." Well, Jeff and other people who like to cold call innocent nerds, here's a tip for you. In today's world, where email and text messages are the norms for communication, I only expect calls from family and friends. If you're a recruiter and you think calling me is going to woo me, you might as well greet me with a big "**SCREW YOU**" because if you're going to piss me off, you might as well do it with a bang. If you want to grab my attention, **send an email** with something more than a generic copy-and-pasted message. I'm all over the Internet, so get your Research Department to figure out what I like, and use that to grab my attention. I didn't tell Jeff to put me on his do not call list; I'm hoping this post gets the message across. Have a good day, Jeff!
