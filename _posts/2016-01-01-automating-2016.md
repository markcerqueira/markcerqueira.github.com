**Happy New Year!** In 2016, I'm making two resolutions: **eat more pizza** and **automate things to make life simpler**. The former will be easy to commit to! I can eat pizza like no other and will continue to devour pizza this year.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2016-01-01/pizza-resolution.jpg"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

The other is a little more difficult to define and execute. But it will have produce value over time. Technology has become great at sucking up everyone's time. I want to turn that around and **leverage technology to help me do things more easily and give me time back**.

Let's do this, 2016!
