On February 2nd - my birthday - my friend John ignored my wishlist of books and instead gifted me the **Remembrance of Earth's Past** trilogy by the acclaimed Chinese science-fiction author Cixin Liu.

    <p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

On February 7th, I started reading the first entry in the trilogy: **The Three Body-Problem**.

On February 9th, I dove into the second entry: **The Dark Forest**.

On February 14th, I started leading the conclusion to the trilogy: **Death's End**. 

On February 18th, I was done reading the **Remembrance of Earth's Past** trilogy.

This reading velocity is definitely on the more extreme end for me but when you stumble upon really good literature you can't help but be pulled in and obsessively spend time reading. This series is a fantastic read from start to finish and I can easily recommend it. Liu is an expert universe builder (world building doesn't capture the magnitude correctly) that keeps readers hooked and keeps pages turning.

The last time I remember being this enthralled with a series was back in 2017 with N.K. Jemisin's [Broken Earth trilogy][1].

For ignoring my wishlist, many, many, many thanks John!
