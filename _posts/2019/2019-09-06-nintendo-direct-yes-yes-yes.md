Nintendo is on a roll and the latest Nintendo Direct doubles down on that. Among the slew of new things announced (Overwatch) and updates on already announced things (Animal Crossing, PokÃ©mon Sword and Shield), three things in particular have me hyped:

* **Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition** - Yes! I [love, love, love][1] the Xenoblade Chronicles series and am very excited to play through this masterpiece again in 2020. I'm still praying to the JRPG gods for a Xenoblade Chronicles X port to the Switch and doubling praying for a sequel to X. Given the Wii was a much popular console compared to the afflicted Wii U, I am confident X would sell incredibly well on the Switch. Come on, who doesn't want JRPG Breath of the Wild? ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž

* **Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore** - Yes! I never got around to playing this Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei mashup, but I'll be able to kick off 2020 on a high note with this quirky game.

* **SNES - Nintendo Switch Online** - Yes! The Nintendo Switch Online service just got a massive upgrade with a collection of great SNES games. This collection includes fantastic gems that were a pillar of my childhood like Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Star Fox, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. While it doesn't have [Super Mario RPG: The Legend of the Seven Stars][3] it does include a JRPG I may dive into: Bread of Fire. Read more about all 20 games available on [Ars Technica][2].

Yes, yes, yes! So much goodness... When is the next Nintendo Direct?
