A collegiate colleague posted a [3 x 3 grid of video games][1] that have impacted him the most. Great and cool idea! I tried to do the same but had a hard time narrowing it down to **just** nine games so I decided to do just JRPGs. After some soul-searching...

<div>
    <img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px; margin-top: 24px;" src="{{ site.images2019 }}/04-02/impact.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px; margin-top: 18px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

While experiencing new things for the first time gave a lot of these games a leg up in delivering impact, entries like Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii) and Nier: Automata (PS4) show there is still room in the modern-day world to move me!
