My 2012 MacBook Pro is still chugging along and can install the latest macOS Mojave but my primary computer at home, a 2008 Mac Pro, is stuck on the 2015 iteration of macOS: El Capitan.

**The largest driver of obsolescence on Apple computers right now is the yearly macOS update cycle.**

I felt the burn most recently trying to get 1Password 7 only to find it requires macOS Sierra or higher. Have no fear, Internet to the rescue! A true hero, dosdude1,  built a tool that allows [installing macOS High Sierra on unsupported Macs][1]. This is similar to the Pikify App I used to [install El Capitan on my cousin's first generation Mac Pro][2].

A few hours later... Success!

    <img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px; margin-top: 24px;" src="{{ site.images2019 }}/04-26/high-sierra.png"/>
    <p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 18px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

With High Sierra now installed I'm confident this 2008 Mac Pro can carry me well into the 2020s. Take that Apple!
