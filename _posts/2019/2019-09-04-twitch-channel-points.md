Channel Points are now available on Twitch on Android, iOS, and Web! This project was a massive undertaking by so many people over the past several months. It feels great to finally release it to the Twitch community. Go forth and highlight messages, unlock emotes, and modify emotes with snazzy sunglasses!

I became the Mobile Engineering Manager for the team working on this project near the tail-end of this project. It presented some interesting challenges as I ramped up working with a new set of folks as we marched towards releasing a very big feature. Leveraging past learnings from the existing team I worked with and focusing on helping keep my team unblocked and productive contributed to a successful launch. Naturally, I walked away with several learnings that will help me in the future.
