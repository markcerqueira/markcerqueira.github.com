The next book in my reading journey once again comes courtesy of the Goodreads Choice Awards of 2018. **Vengeful** by V.E. Schwab won in the [Science Fiction][1] category and given it was a sequel to **Vicious** I read both of them.

I enjoyed reading both books. The anti-hero superhero theme gave both books a very fresh starting point. Here there are no heroes or singular villain but rather people - some ExtraOrdinary - doing what they feel is right and others taking serious issue with their interpretation. While Vengeful picks up where Vicious left off and generally wraps up the story, I found the opening act - Vicious - to be a more enjoyable read. Vengeful introduced a lot more characters and story arcs to follow that made it a bit more difficult to track. 

Vicious hooked me but there were times where I didn't feel bad putting Vengeful down. If you're into superhero stuff but want to spice things up a bit you should check out these two books. If Vicious hooks you, definitely pick up Vengeful.
