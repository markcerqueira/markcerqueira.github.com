After getting hooked on the [ridiculously long demo][1], I dove into **Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age** when it came out for the Switch at the end of September. **118 hours later**, I'm finally done with the game!

This game is great! You build a unique cast of characters and the game does a good job of developing each of their personal stories. The world is big but doesn't feel like it's repeating itself; the overworld music being shared across snowy tundras and dry deserts doesn't help here though. The story - divided into three acts - takes a while to go through. Some plot twists are expected and easy to see coming, especially for those who have played previous Dragon Quest games but the end of Act 2 really took me by surprise.

My gripes with the game are relatively minor, but if ever addressed, would make Dragon Quest XI an all-time great:

* A repetitive soundtrack - the battle theme being reused in the horse races takes the cake here for me.
* A silent protagonist - give him a voice!
* Painful item management - transferring items from the Item Bag to each character is annoying.

Waiting for the Definitive Edition on the Switch was worth the wait as it [includes many quality-of-life improvements and additional content][2]. This includes an optional superboss, the Timewyrm, that challenges you both in strong it is and in how quick you can defeat it. I took it down in 43 actions which earned me the Warp-Speed Wyrminator accolade. Accolades are the in-game trophy system; we should all continue to pray for Nintendo to one day build a proper trophy system. üôè

Overall, I am very pleased with Dragon Quest XI. It's a JRPG through and through that I very much enjoyed.
