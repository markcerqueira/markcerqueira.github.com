After months of teasers and announcements of everything except a release date, GungHo finally delivered on giving us a release date for the **Grandia HD Collection:** 10 days from today on August 16th! This collection releasing on the Switch and PC includes Grandia and Grandia II.

    <p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 6px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

This is an easy must-buy for me especially since it's coming to the Switch. Grandia II is one of my [favorite JRPGs][1]: the story, the characters, [the music][3], the battle system, the creepy laughs during that one battle, [Sky Dragon Slash][2] - it's all so good! Playing through the original Grandia has also been on my todo list for a while so I'm looking forward to diving into it next Friday.

If you're looking for a great JRPG experience to sink your teeth into, I cannot recommend Grandia enough!

P.S. Speaking of great JRPGs that were on the Dreamcast, can we please get Skies of Arcadia again!?
