It‚Äôs the New Year so it‚Äôs the most wonderful time of the year for goal-setting. All my goals this year will strive to be **measurable** and **verifiable**. Given there are twelve months in the year the central theme tying all goals will be our good friend the number 12.

* **Read 12 leadership books.** Given the Manager Book Club currently meets on a monthly cadence and I read thirteen leadership books in about a six month period last year this one should be easy. I love running the club and am excited for the twelve gatherings we‚Äôll have in 2019.

* **Read 12 ‚Äúregular‚Äù books.** While reading leadership books has been great at establishing a framework and vocabulary for how I have approached my role at Twitch, I would also like to spend some time reading ‚Äúregular‚Äù books. I only read one, [A Tale for the Time Being][1], in 2018 and I really enjoyed it. My plan for 2019 is to interweave leadership and non-leadership books to introduce some regular variety and keep things spicy.

* **Make 12 new meaningful connections.** In 2019 I would like to expand my network - professional and personal - by meeting 12 new people and making 12 new meaningful connections. The measure of success here is not perfectly verifiable but I hope to end 2019 with twelve new people I can confidently say are part of my network.

* **Lose 12 pounds.** My wife cooks mouth-watering delicious meals. Twitch has outrageously yummy food. Whole Foods now stocks Humphrey Slocombe ice cream, which is the best ice cream in the world. On top of all this, I haven‚Äôt been exercising nearly as much as I should. In 2019 I aim to shed a pound a month.

* **Play no more than 12 games.** I love video games but as far as ROI on the time, especially JRPGs, I invest to the fulfillment I get out of video games there are just better things to do. In 2019 my goal is to play 12 or less video games. Given I play the never-ending StarCraft 2, Fire Emblem: Heroes, and Pok√©mon Go, I‚Äôm already down to nine for the rest of the year. Yikes!

* **Write 12 blog posts per month.** This one is too ambitious given I wrote 69 posts in 2018 but the theme of 12 must be respected. I don‚Äôt expect to succeed here but if I come remotely close I‚Äôll be happy.

* **Run at least 12 race miles.** The [last race I ran was a 5K in September 2017][2]. In 2019 I want to log 12+ miles in races. This can be four 5Ks, two 10Ks, or I can get it out of the way in one fell swoop with a half-marathon!

Whether 2019 ends in overwhelming twelve-themed success or failure, I'll provide an update a year from now. May your 2019 be filled with good times and opportunities for growth! üôè
