Happy birthday to my good friend, Josh Wu, and happy birthday to the venerable mark.gg!

The past year has been a busy one. I got married! After eight years of Android and iOS development, I recently completed my first year as a Mobile Engineering Manager. I also got back into reading, focusing on leadership books in my [Manager Reads series][1] but also devoured the amazing [Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy][2]. 

2020 here we come!
