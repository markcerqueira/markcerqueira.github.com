There’s plenty of critical acclaim for **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33** and I’m right there with everyone else. Did Expedition 33 ruin gaming? Not exactly. But it did set the bar so high that even two solid games I picked up after felt like a slog.

<div>
    <img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: {{ site.default_image_width }}; border: 1px; margin-top: 24px;" src="{{ site.images2025 }}/10-14/gustave.jpg"/>
    <p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>What have you done??</strong></p>
</div>

Since finishing Expedition 33, I played **Donkey Kong Bananza** and **Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles** on the Switch 2. Bananza is fine - good, even - but nowhere near what the internet hyped it up to be. And as a longtime Final Fantasy fan, I expected to lose myself in Tactics again (I played the War of the Lions version on the PSP many years ago), especially with the buzz around the polish and quality-of-life improvements. Instead, both felt like chores just a few hours in. Why? Simple. Expedition 33 was so damn good it ruined gaming for me.
