Don't wait for 2014 to start working toward your goals -- **start today.** I can't run a marathon today, but I've got 40 weeks to sort it all out. I was one of those people who'd make resolutions on New Year's Eve. And then by the middle of January, I'd be back to my old ways. Come the following New Year's Eve, I'd be back to make promises I deep down inside knew I wouldn't keep. Don't waste any time working towards your goals. And don't wait for a new year to get started -- **start today**.
