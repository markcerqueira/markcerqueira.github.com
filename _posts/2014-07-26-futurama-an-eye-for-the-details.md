I appreciate an eye for the details, even when they may appear to be so minor or inconsequential. I recently revisited the pilot episode of Futurama where Fry -- on December 31, 1999 -- is transported 1000 years into the future. Later on in the episode, his newfound robot friend Bender says they can hide in a museum because "it's free on Tuesdays."

<div>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

My trusty general-purpose calculator Wolfram Alpha confirms that December 31, 2999 is in fact a Tuesday. Yes, it's a small detail. Yes, they could've just picked a random day and hoped they were right. But caring enough to get this small detail right is pretty dang cool.
