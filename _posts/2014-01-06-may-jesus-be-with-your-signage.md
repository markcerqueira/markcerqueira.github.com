Over the holidays I dropped by the Portuguese Consulate in Newark, NJ to take care of some top secret diplomatic business. An engineer by trade, I secretly harbor an anal-retentive designer in the depths of my heart. While waiting to take care of some important business, I peered over at the welcome signage and cried out in pain.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px; margin-top: 30px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-01-06/typography.jpg"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>Hallelujah! Jesus-Christ-certified Identity Cards!</b></p>
</div>

Jesus Christ! They spelled **bilhetes** with a Latin Cross (**✝**)! This was also the only occurrence of this most holy swap on the entire signage. I didn't have the gall to ask the front desk what was up with the Jesus-infused character set. Was it a zealous designer subtly informing us that Catholicism is the dominant religion in Portugal? Maybe. I'd like to believe it was divine interven✝ion...
