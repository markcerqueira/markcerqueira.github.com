The other day I got a follower on Instagram. Yay! But, I think this follower was a scammer. Any time someone on the internet invites you to visit a website to get to know them better, it's usually a scam. Especially when their name is MissDiamond. Bummer!

Like any good community member, I decided to report this user. Here's what the "reporting a user on Instagram" user flow looks like.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-11-18/instagram.gif"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

See that last screen where Instagram thanks me for reporting this user? I sat on that screen for a while. Little did I know I had to **press "Cancel" in the top left to dismiss the confirmation**. That's pretty bad. I just completed doing something. Don't make me doubt myself by forcing me to hit a button that says "Cancel." Put a button that says "OK" or something more positive! **Finish the flow, please!**
