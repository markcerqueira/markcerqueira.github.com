I previously wrote about the [Instagram "report user" user experience][1], which I felt left users hanging at the end. I noticed the problematic part of the flow has recently been changed! But I'm unsure how I feel about the changes. Here's the new "report user" flow:

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-09-06/donedone3.gif"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>DONE and DONE!</strong></p>
</div>

Check out that last frame where you are thanked for reporting the offending user. Before, if you reported someone Instagram made you hit "Cancel" to dismiss the confirmation but now it gives you **TWO** "DONE" buttons. This new UX paradigm which I dub **Better Safe Than Sorry UX - let's just put the button twice to ensure users get it** is pretty innovative, certainly strange, and questionably provides a good user experience.
