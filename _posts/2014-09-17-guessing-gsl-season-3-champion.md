<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">GOM eXP -- the company that hosts Korea's StarCraft World Championship Series -- challenged fans to <b>guess which players Artosis and Tasteless predicted to win the tournament</b>. Here's what they told us:</p>

* Artosis and Tasteless made their predictions before the round of 16 began.
* Pick one Zerg who couldn't advance to the round of 8.
* Pick one Protoss who did advance to the round of 8.

We start with sixteen potential candidates, but we can narrow down the choices down significantly. The Zergs who didn't advance are **Soulkey**, **Effort**, **True**. The Protoss who advanced were **Zest**, **Rain**, **Stats**.

My guess is **Tasteless picked Effort** and **Artosis picked Rain**.

**Tasteless** has been super passionate about Effort who he says is back in "Brood War" shape. Tasteless is also a lot more passionate about Brood War because sometime recently he apparently lost his passion.

**Artosis** -- a.k.a. Captain Safety -- loves Rain's super-safe play. Also, on the first day of the round of 8, Artosis has been saying Rain is going to make it to the finals and take it all. That said, he could just be trolling everyone...

What do you think? Share your guess on the [GOM eXP Facebook page][1] or [tweet at me][2] about how I lost my passion for writing sensical and relevant blog posts.

**Update!** I was half right. Artosis picked Rain, but Tasteless picked True!
