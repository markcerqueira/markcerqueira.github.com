Say what you will about Square Enix, but lately I think they're dishing outs lots of love.

* The release date for **Final Fantasy XV** was announced and it's only 6 months away: September 30th! Can't wait? No worries! Square Enix also released the **Platinum Demo** for you to check out today.
* Not only are we getting a game, Final Fantasy XV will also have a short animated series called **Brotherhood** to introduce the FFXV story. And there will also be a full-length feature CGI film called **Kingsglaive**. You can watch the [first episode of Brotherhood][1] and the [Kingsglaive trailer][2] on YouTube.
* **Bravely Second: End Layer** hits North American shores in two weeks. If you long for a Final Fantasy that is more traditional, stop complaining about the modern Final Fantasy games and pick up this awesome old-school JRPG. If you somehow haven't played the original Bravely Default yet, do it now!
* The beloved **Dragon Quest VII and Dragon Quest VIII** will be re-released on the 3DS in North America in 2016. Originally released on the Playstation and Playstation 2 respectively, these re-releases will bring the number of Dragon Quest games you can play on a North American 3DS to six (i.e. IV through IX)!
* The North American release date for **Star Ocean 5** was also announced this week: June 28th! Entries in the series since the beloved Star Ocean 2 have received mixed reviews, but with a solid 34/40 from Famitsu, Star Ocean 5 is shaping up to be a solid JRPG entry in 2016. Not appealing enough? The Day One Edition will allow you swap out the battle music with the [Valkyrie Profile battle themes][3]!

This is great stuff! The only thing missing here is a Valkyrie Profile 3 announcement!
