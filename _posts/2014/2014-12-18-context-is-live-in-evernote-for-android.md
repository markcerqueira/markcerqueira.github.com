It's been a little over a month since I joined Team Android at Evernote. I'm happy to announce that I've been busy along with the rest of the team bringing you an update to our Android app. Among many other things, **Evernote for Android now supports Context!**

What is Context? Say you're procrastinating at work browsing the Washington Post, and you run into an article about Japan recently beating out Scotland for top scotch of the year. Take that Scotland! You use the [Evernote Web Clipper][1] to save it to your ever-growing notebook of articles you promise you'll read one day.

Months later, you finally get around to reading that article. You reach the end and normally that'd be the end. But with Context, you'll find articles and notes related to the one you just finished reading. Context pulls content from sources like The Wall Street Journal, your own notes, and even your LinkedIn contacts. 

I'm biased, but I think it's pretty cool. The "classical model of intelligence" is based around how much you can remember without any tools to assist you. But today people have extremely powerful and more importantly - extremely connected - devices in their pockets. I think the "modern model of intelligence" assesses how quickly we are able to access the information we need. Evernote remembers everything for us, so we're covered there pretty well. Now, Context helps us find related information that can further augment our knowledge and increase our productivity. That is, unless spending an afternoon reading about scotch is not your definition of productive!
