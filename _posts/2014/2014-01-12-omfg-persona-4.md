I'll never forget the first video game I ever played: Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES). And I'll never forget the first time I fell in love with a game: Super Mario RPG and the Legend of the Seven Stars (SNES). Times have changed and so have I, and the *magic* of video games seems to have waned. So in order not to feel disappointed most of the time, I tell myself, "You're not a kid anymore. It's not going to be as magical anymore." Yet, there are rare moments when I feel like a kid all over again. It's moments like these that I realize I'm playing a game that is going to join the Pantheon of Greats, which features amazing (mostly JRPG) games like Xenoblade, Chrono Trigger, Terranigma, Final Fantasy VI, Valkyrie Profile, and Grandia II.

Most recently, this happened with Persona 4 Golden (P4G) for the Playstation Vita. It was truly a game that excited me from start to finish. An enhanced re-release of the PS2 original, P4G knocked my socks off. I don't need to write a long rave review about this game; there are already plenty of them out there. In short, this game is novel, quirky (in the best way), wonderfully designed, and was *an absolute pleasure to play and experience*. Even though exposure to lots of video games as well as adulthood has made me feel jaded at times, I am happy to report that there is still magic out there.... So the hunt continues!
