It's hard to believe today marks a year since my first blog post. I originally started bloging to improve and refine my writing chops, and to rant about things like work, video games, food, and fitness. It's been a busy year, with a whopping **54 blog posts** (one per week!). Some months were very busy (10 posts in July), while others were likely filled with extreme video gaming (only one post in November). Here's to another year filled with interesting experiences and waxing on poetic about them!
