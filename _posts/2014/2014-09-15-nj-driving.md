  	<p>I was &mdash; as one of my friends put it &mdash; "born, raised, and pretentiously educated in New Jersey" before moving to California. It's been four years since I left the Garden State, but I come back pretty often to visit family. One of the best parts of visiting is being constantly reminded how <i>good</i> the typical New Jersey driver is, and how my own driving skills have degraded while being away.</p>

Here are some things I don't do quite as well anymore:

* Tailgating. Together, we're all Jersey Strong. 
* Make turns without a turn signal.
* ~~Cutting people off~~ Merging almost on top of someone next to me.
* Squeezing in between two cars; one of which is tailgating the other. 
* Drive more ~~aggressively~~ assertively. 
* Change lanes without a turn signal.
* See someone ahead trying to merge into my lane. Speed up quickly to block them from doing so.
* Show off how long my middle finger is to fellow travelers. 
* Ensure my car horn works by using it every minute.
* Responding to the honker behind me, by showing them how well my brakes work.

Nothing says "Welcome Home!" like driving in New Jersey.
