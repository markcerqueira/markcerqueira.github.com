It could always get better, but as things stand right now, QR codes suck. Here's my most recent **GOD-AWFUL experience with QR codes**. I was at my favorite bubble tea place in the world: ShareTea in San Mateo. While waiting for my drink to be brought down from heaven by angels, I saw a sign posted on the wall.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-06/sharetea.jpg"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

I thought to myself, "Aww yeah! I'll follow you on Instagram." I pulled out my iPhone, launched the Camera app, pointed it at the QR code, and waited. **Nothing.** I launched Instagram, switched to camera mode, and repeated. **Nothing.**

Stuff just isn't right here!

**The advertisement should include the Instagram username.** Seems pretty negligent to exclude it given how short usernames typically are: in this case shareteasanmateo. But isn't the whole point of the QR code to eliminate the need for us to type out that username?

The larger issue here is **built-in QR code support sucks.** It sucks on iOS. It sucks on Android. To read QR codes, you need to download an app... And there a ton of them! Seriously, I can google for the "best QR code reader on iOS [or Android]," and there are actually a plethora of relevant hits.

But once I settled for an app, the experience did not really get any better. 

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 300px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-10-06/casinotea.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

Scanning the above QR code, I am taken to the ShareTea's Instagram page in an embedded browser, featuring ads for some Zynga-esque casino game. And that's it. I can't hit the follow button because I'm not logged into Instagram in this embedded browser. I still don't know the username because it's no where to be found on the webpage -- hats off to the Instagram team! I actually need to click on the URL and navigate to the end to see it. Then I need to do that click-hold gesture and drag to select just the username, copy it, open Instagram, paste it and FINALLY, I can follow ShareTea.

What did the QR code get me? **Nothing.** It's not helpful. It's not faster. It's actually very frustrating.

In an ideal world, the OS on my phone should recognize and parse a QR code into a common format (the hardest part here) that can **do more than simply open a webpage**.  In that wonderful future, I would just launch the Camera app, point it at the QR code, the QR code would contain an app identifier (e.g Instagram), and metadata related to the end-goal (e.g. following ShareTea). The Camera app notifies me that the QR code wants to launch Instagram. If I accept, it takes me into the app, and then to the user's page before finally asking me to follow them.

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>One day, those may be tears of happiness...</strong></p>
</div>

Hang in there QR codes! You suck now, but **there is hope for the future**!
