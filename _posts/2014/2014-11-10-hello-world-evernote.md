I'm very excited to announce that after four fun years at Smule, I'm joining the Evernote Team! Here's a picture of (dapper) me on my first day.

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-11-10/evernote.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

More specifically, I'll be joining their Android team. I'm pumped to work on a great product used by millions of people around the world! Here's to a long and fulfilling experience!
