Yelp, we've got a problem. A serious problem. I really like what you're doing, but you should know that **commas cannot join two sentences**. Yet every time someone sends a friend request, the placeholder sentence is a classic example of a comma splice. 

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-14/spliced.png"/>
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>That comma should be a period or a semicolon.</strong></p>
</div>

I already shed enough tears on behalf of the English language when I read some people's reviews. Yelp, please do your part and stop this unnecessary propagation of terrible grammar. Your community will thank you.

P.S. Also, tell your engineers that they really should get around to replacing "**[link to your page]**" with the actual link to my page. iOS developers can check out the stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString method and Android developers can use the replace method. Happy coding fellow developers!
