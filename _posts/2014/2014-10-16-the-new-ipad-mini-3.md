Today, Apple unveiled new iPads. This included an update to the iPad Mini: the iPad Mini 3. The older iPad Mini 2 got a $100 price cut too. Now, let's play a game. One year after the iPad Mini 2 was released, what's new in the iPad Mini 3? Here is a picture compiled from the comparison chart Apple provides on its site.

If you got to the end, and found that (aside from price) the only new thing in the iPad Mini 3 is Touch ID (Fingerprint identity sensor), you've won the game! Huzzah! Today felt more like a price-drop announcement for the iPad Mini 2 than the unveiling of a new and awesome iPad Mini 3.
