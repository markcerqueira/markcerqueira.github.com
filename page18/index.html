        A Taste of Portugal
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>A lot of people always ask me, “What do Portuguese people eat?” I usually just say, “We eat A LOT!” But for those unsatisfied with that answer, here are some of the things I ate during a recent visit to my Portuguese family in New Jersey.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/papo_seco.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Papo Seco com manteiga</strong>- The Portuguese Roll (papo seco) is bread in its supreme form. My ideal Portuguese breakfast is a toasted and buttered (manteiga) Portuguese Roll with a glass of soy milk. Delicious!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/caldoverde.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Caldo Verde</strong> - A quintessential Portuguese dish consisting of potatoes, collard greens, and usually sausage (chouriço). This soup is normally served at parties and celebrations, but, growing up, my family served it at Sunday dinners. The soup pairs really well with broa (Portuguese cornbread), but I always ate mine with a Portuguese Roll.</p>

<!--break-->

<p><br /></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/febras.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Febras com Cebolada</strong> - A simple but wonderful dish. Pan-fried boneless pork cutlets served with sautéed onions and peppers. Once again, the almighty Portuguese Roll is an excellent vessel for serving this dish.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/arrozcabidela.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Arroz de Cabidela</strong> - My favorite way to cook rice: in the BLOOD OF CHICKENS! I’m not sure if this is simply a myth but they say this dish was inherited from the Sephardi Jews. Rather than twisting the neck of the chicken to kill it, the Sephardi Jews would slit the chicken’s throat and then hang it to drain the blood. Enterprising Portuguese realized you should not waste the blood and cooked the rice in it with a bit of vinegar. Morbid, but tasty!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/acorda.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Açorda de Camarão</strong> - My family is from the northwestern-most Alto Minho region of Portugal. But this dish is from the south-central Alentejo region. This dish may look like a huge mushy disaster, but it’s actually very tasty. The main ingredients are mashed bread and shrimp. Codfish/bacalhau is another common fish used in this dish.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/bacalhau_bras.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Bacalhau à Brás</strong> - It’s made with shredded pieces of codfish (bacalhau), onions, scrambled eggs, and french fries. I’m not usually a huge fan of codfish, but when this dish comes out, I am suddenly a huge fan.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/estufada.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Carne de Vaca Estufada</strong> - Another one of my favorite dishes is steamed (estufada) cow (vaca) meat (carne). This is commonly served with mashed potatoes and green peas. My mom also makes rice because my sister and dad don’t believe in mashed potatoes. I’m not sure what goes into making the marinade the meat rests in, but it goes so well as a gravy on the mashed potatoes!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-28/pasteis.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Pastel de Nata</strong> - Custard cups are the perfect end to every meal. My Asian friends say these look a lot like Chinese Egg Tarts. Except (incoming UNBIASED Portuguese opinion) these are WAY BETTER!</p>

<p>And that’s that. Suddenly overcome with saudades of Portuguese food, I need to go book a ticket to visit home again!</p>

    <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>During my visit to NJ, I convinced my former thesis advisor, Dan Trueman, that it’d be a good idea to hang out with me. He fell for it! A few days later, I sat in his office and we had a pleasant talk about all sorts of things. But at some point my eyes wandered to a beautiful folded piece of paper held together by two equally beautiful, yellow rubber bands. <strong>What is this wonderful machination?</strong> I reached out for it. I was touching <strong>pure beauty</strong>…</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-1.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p>Dan interrupted my special moment with the folded piece of paper. <strong>“That’s my new album.”</strong> Dear God, Dan! You’re telling me this isn’t a gift from God?! It’s a music album?! I looked back at the album and noticed the two pairs of 10 lines. “It’s a collaboration between me and Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh.” Sounds Irish to me. You know what else is near Ireland? NORWAY! And you know what’s from Norway and has 10 strings? <strong>HARDANGER FIDDLES!</strong> Dan seemed impressed by my deductive reasoning.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-2.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>But my mind had only begun to be blown. The paper felt Californian in nature – very, very recycled. “The album is very “green.” It uses soy-based inks on sustainable paper at a factory that produces its own electricity. Wowzers! But then Dan floored me. “The water leaving the plant is cleaner than it is when it enters.” Are you kidding me? This album is also helping the environment?!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-3.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>Dan told me I could have the copy with which I shared such an intimate moment… If I listened to it. I took it, admired it the entire way home, and then I listened to it. I’m not really good at explaining music, but <strong>I enjoyed it</strong>. My favorite track was “What What What” because it has an awesome name, and it’s the track that I could best visualize Dan jamming out too.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 800px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-20/laghdu-4.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>Some may say physical media is dead, but not only is Laghdú a pleasure to listen to, it <strong>revived my faith in media physica</strong>. The album comes out in a week on September 27th. You can order a copy of this majestic beauty from <a href="http://store.irishmusic.net/album/laghd">store.irishmusic.net</a>. For those heathens not taken with the beauty of the album cover, there’s a digital option too. But you’re not a heathen, are you?!</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">GOM eXP -- the company that hosts Korea's StarCraft World Championship Series -- challenged fans to <b>guess which players Artosis and Tasteless predicted to win the tournament</b>. Here's what they told us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Artosis and Tasteless made their predictions before the round of 16 began.</li>
  <li>Pick one Zerg who couldn’t advance to the round of 8.</li>
  <li>Pick one Protoss who did advance to the round of 8.</li>
</ul>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>Results from the round of 16 courtesy of Liquipedia.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>We start with sixteen potential candidates, but we can narrow down the choices down significantly. The Zergs who didn’t advance are <strong>Soulkey</strong>, <strong>Effort</strong>, <strong>True</strong>. The Protoss who advanced were <strong>Zest</strong>, <strong>Rain</strong>, <strong>Stats</strong>.</p>

<p>My guess is <strong>Tasteless picked Effort</strong> and <strong>Artosis picked Rain</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tasteless</strong> has been super passionate about Effort who he says is back in “Brood War” shape. Tasteless is also a lot more passionate about Brood War because sometime recently he apparently lost his passion.</p>

<p><strong>Artosis</strong> – a.k.a. Captain Safety – loves Rain’s super-safe play. Also, on the first day of the round of 8, Artosis has been saying Rain is going to make it to the finals and take it all. That said, he could just be trolling everyone…</p>

<p>What do you think? Share your guess on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialeXP">GOM eXP Facebook page</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira">tweet at me</a> about how I lost my passion for writing sensical and relevant blog posts.</p>

<p><strong>Update!</strong> I was half right. Artosis picked Rain, but Tasteless picked True!</p>

  	<p>I was &mdash; as one of my friends put it &mdash; "born, raised, and pretentiously educated in New Jersey" before moving to California. It's been four years since I left the Garden State, but I come back pretty often to visit family. One of the best parts of visiting is being constantly reminded how <i>good</i> the typical New Jersey driver is, and how my own driving skills have degraded while being away.</p>
</div>

<p>Here are some things I don’t do quite as well anymore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tailgating. Together, we’re all Jersey Strong.</li>
  <li>Make turns without a turn signal.</li>
  <li><del>Cutting people off</del> Merging almost on top of someone next to me.</li>
  <li>Squeezing in between two cars; one of which is tailgating the other.</li>
  <li>Drive more <del>aggressively</del> assertively.</li>
  <li>Change lanes without a turn signal.</li>
  <li>See someone ahead trying to merge into my lane. Speed up quickly to block them from doing so.</li>
  <li>Show off how long my middle finger is to fellow travelers.</li>
  <li>Ensure my car horn works by using it every minute.</li>
  <li>Responding to the honker behind me, by showing them how well my brakes work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing says “Welcome Home!” like driving in New Jersey.</p>

        Do I Need a New Computer?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2014</span>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Instead of assuming you do and spending a ton of money, <strong>ask yourself these three questions first</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does my computer turn on?</li>
  <li>Do I have a solid-state drive (SSD)?</li>
  <li>Do I have enough memory/RAM?</li>
</ol>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/destroyed.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>If your laptop looks like this, you probably should get a new one.</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Most people’s computers are just fine.</strong> But if your computer is damaged to the point where it won’t even power on or the display is not functional, you probably need a new computer. But if the chief complaint is how slow it is, you can usually alleviate that – at a fraction of the cost of a new computer – by exploring the second and third questions.</p>

<!--break-->

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - if your computer is slow and you don’t have an SSD and have not maxed out RAM, consider upgrading those before purchasing a new computer!</p>

<hr class="separator" />

<h3 id="ssd">SSD</h3>

<p>An SSD is the <strong>single best upgrade</strong> you can get for your computer. Most computers you buy come with a traditional rotational hard drive (HDD). These drives work by writing and reading data, with a mechanical arm, on platters. These operations require spinning the platters and moving the arm around. Think of it like an old-school record player.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/ssd.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>The Samsung 840 EVO is pretty well-regarded.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>HDDs are slow and are usually the bottleneck in your computer: every other component is simply faster. By <strong>upgrading to an SSD, you’ll get a snappier system</strong>: the laptop will boot faster, applications will open faster, and your life in general will improve. This is because the write and read speeds of an SSD are significantly higher compared to an HDD.</p>

<p>You may be wondering, “If SSDs are so much better than HDDs, why don’t all computers come with them?” Like most things in life the answer is <strong>money</strong>. Per gigabyte, SSDs are more expensive than their rotational brethren. How much more expensive? Prices vary from drive to drive, but here’s an example. With a Western Digital 500 GB laptop HDD, you are paying <strong>$0.09 per gigabyte</strong>. With a Samsung Evo 250 GB SSD, you are paying <strong>$0.51 cents per gigabyte</strong>. That’s almost 6 times more expensive per gigabyte!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Is it worth it? <strong>Yes it is!!!</strong> Consider all these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speed! Different tests produce different results, but SSDs are blazing fast. Some tests show SSDs being 10x faster than HDDs!</li>
  <li>Less noisy! HDDs have moving parts; SSDs do not. This means SSDs do not make noise from vibrations of moving parts, generate less heat, and use less power.</li>
  <li>Magnet-safe! Magnets can actually destroy data on HDDs, but SSDs are impervious to magnets. Huzzah!</li>
  <li>Speed! Did I mention how fast they are already?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get a 250 GB Samsung EVO SSD for $130. If you need a larger drive, a 500 GB SSD costs $250, and a 1 TB SSD costs $430.</p>

<p>To summarize (hyperbole incoming): With an SSD, you will go from waiting on your computer, to having your computer wait on you! Check out this in-depth article on <a href="http://www.storagereview.com/ssd_vs_hdd">SSDs vs. HDDs by Storage Review</a> if you’d like to know more.</p>

<hr class="separator" />

<h3 id="ram">RAM</h3>

<p>Up next is <strong>RAM.</strong> When you open programs, they are loaded into RAM. If you open a lot of apps (or have very little RAM), your computer needs to move stuff out of RAM to make room for the new app. It does this by copying data from RAM to your HDD (or SSD). If you start using the app that was moved out, the computer swaps something else out and brings that app back into RAM. This swapping in and out is slow, especially if you have an old-school HDD.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/ram.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>There are many types of RAM (e.g. DDR2, DDR3, PC3-8500, PC3-12800).<br /> Make sure you get the right one!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Upgrading to an SSD makes the swapping process faster, but not having to do the swapping in the first place is the best way to go. These days, <strong>4 GB of memory is recommended</strong>, but <strong>you can’t go wrong with 8 GB or even 16 GB</strong> if you’re doing a lot of multi-tasking. Look up how to measure “page ins” and “page outs” in your particular operating system. Page in and page outs are the formal name for the swapping process. A ton of page ins are okay, but if you have a comparable amount of page outs you could probably benefit from more RAM.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/paging.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>On a Mac, open Activity Monitor to compare your page ins vs. page outs.<br />If your page outs are significantly lower than your page ins, you're in good shape!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>There are a ton of different types of RAM and the price ranges vary somewhat. On average, you’ll pay about $10 per gigabyte of RAM, so 8 GB of RAM will cost about $80.</p>

<hr class="separator" />

<h3 id="counterpoint----when-you-cant-or-shouldnt-upgrade">Counterpoint – When You Can’t or Shouldn’t Upgrade</h3>

<p>Now, this advice isn’t all-encompassing as <strong>some laptops don’t have user-upgradeable hard drives or RAM</strong>. For example, the newest line of Macbook Pros do not have user-upgradeable RAM. On the other hand, while the SSDs are not your standard 2.5-inch drives, they can be upgraded. <a href="http://www.transcend-info.com/apple/jetdrive/">Transcend</a> makes JetDrive SSDs for these Apple machines that require quirky SSDs and the upgrade process is very straightforward.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-09-13/chrome.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>If you can't upgrade your Mac to Snow Leopard (10.6), you can't install Google Chrome!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Also, if your computer is ten years old, it probably isn’t worth upgrading. All the technology (beyond the HDD/SSD and RAM) in your machine is outdated. For example, older 32-bit CPUs cannot address more than 4 GB of RAM so you can’t upgrade beyond that. Also, you may be unable to upgrade your OS, and software manufactures may stop supporting your older OS. For example, Google Chrome for Mac requires Mac OS Snow Leopard. Snow Leopard requires an Intel CPU. If you have an older Mac that doesn’t have an Intel CPU, you can’t install Google Chrome. In cases like this, you shouldn’t invest in an SSD or more RAM.</p>

<p>Also, the types of HDD/SDD and RAM that are compatible with your machine may be so old, that manufacturers don’t produce as much (or any) of that item. Older versions of RAM, like DDR2, are actually more expensive than the newer DDR3 because DDR2 is no longer manufactured at a high rate (if at all).</p>

<hr class="separator" />

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>You should be able to get 4-6 years out of most computers. These upgrades can make this period of time a happy reality. If you’re feeling the crunch and are thinking about upgrading to an SSD and more RAM, consider that a 250 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM will run you around $200, which is a lot cheaper than any new (and decent) computer! I’ve helped friends and family members with these upgrades. They are always amazed at the breath of new (and speedy) life given to what they thought was an “almost dead” computer. If you’re buying a computer that cannot be upgraded, it’s important to make sure you are leaving enough of a cushion so your computer lasts into the future: for example, buying more RAM than you think you might need right now.</p>

<p>If you’re curious but have no idea what to do next, or want some personally-tailored advice, <strong>just let me know</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Since we’re talking about computers so much, remember to <a href="http://mark.gg/2014/01/24/back-it-up/">back it up</a>!</p>

<hr class="separator" />

<p style="font-size: 0.75em;"><b>NOTE:</b> Every situation is unique, and these suggestions might not apply to you specifically. Ask me or a professional if you aren’t sure! Also, I refer to laptops and computers interchangeably. This post focuses more on laptops; on a PC you can upgrade even more things that weren't discussed here.</p>
