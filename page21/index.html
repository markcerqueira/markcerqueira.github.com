        Futurama - An Eye for the Details
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>I appreciate an eye for the details, even when they may appear to be so minor or inconsequential. I recently revisited the pilot episode of Futurama where Fry – on December 31, 1999 – is transported 1000 years into the future. Later on in the episode, his newfound robot friend Bender says they can hide in a museum because “it’s free on Tuesdays.”</p>

<div>

	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>My trusty general-purpose calculator Wolfram Alpha confirms that December 31, 2999 is in fact a Tuesday. Yes, it’s a small detail. Yes, they could’ve just picked a random day and hoped they were right. But caring enough to get this small detail right is pretty dang cool.</p>

        Please Take My Money Sony
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>Man, I can’t believe I’m saying this but <strong>SONY, PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY</strong>. I was just trying to buy some video games in the PlayStation Store. When I was adding funds to my account, I kept getting an error when inputting my credit card details: “please enter a valid credit card number.” Double-checked the number, the expiration date, the security code, and name on the credit card and tried again. <strong>ERROR</strong>. Double-checked my billing address. <strong>ERROR</strong>. What’s going on, Sony!?</p>

<p>After digging around online, I find I’m not the only person with credit card input issues on Sony’s website. After a ton of “me too, I hate Sony” posts, I found a helpful netizen who suggested making sure the billing address inputted on Sony’s website EXACTLY matches your credit card’s billing address. Now I can understand having to get a billing address correct when authorizing a transaction, but Sony is handling this somewhat poorly.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>First of all, if there is an error with my billing address, don’t tell me to “enter a valid credit card number.” Tell me to check the actual issue: the billing address.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sony has to loosen up their billing address verification. For example, let’s say my address is 120 Lombard Street / Apt G (the slash indicates the separation from the first and second address line). For some reason, my credit card company swaps these two lines and lists my billing address has APT G / 120 LOMBARD ST. Here’s what Sony does not accept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>120 LOMBARD STREET / APT G</li>
  <li>120 LOMBARD ST / APT G</li>
  <li>120 LOMBARD ST APT G / [blank]</li>
</ul>

<p>What Sony will accept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>APT G / 120 LOMBARD ST - exactly as listed on my credit card</li>
  <li>Apt G / 120 Lombard St - case insensitive</li>
  <li>Apartment G / 120 Lombard Street - abbreviations (e.g. ST and APT) can be expanded</li>
  <li>APT G 120 LOMBARD ST / [blank] - lines 1 and 2 can be combined onto a single line</li>
  <li>APT [unit purposefully omitted] / 120 Lombard Street - what apartment doesn’t matter</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, this isn’t totally unreasonable on Sony’s part, but it seems kind of silly that when it comes to address lines, order REALLY matters. Other websites don’t care about order of the address lines, and gas stations only care about the zip code. Loosen up a bit, Sony!</p>

<p>Anyhow, now that I’ve pontificated thoroughly on this issue, I’ll definitely remember the next time I run into issues spending money with Sony.</p>

        Shame on Yelp, See What I Did There?

    <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>Yelp, we’ve got a problem. A serious problem. I really like what you’re doing, but you should know that <strong>commas cannot join two sentences</strong>. Yet every time someone sends a friend request, the placeholder sentence is a classic example of a comma splice.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-14/spliced.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>That comma should be a period or a semicolon.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>I already shed enough tears on behalf of the English language when I read some people’s reviews. Yelp, please do your part and stop this unnecessary propagation of terrible grammar. Your community will thank you.</p>

<p>P.S. Also, tell your engineers that they really should get around to replacing “<strong>[link to your page]</strong>” with the actual link to my page. iOS developers can check out the stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString method and Android developers can use the replace method. Happy coding fellow developers!</p>

        Tales of Awesome
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>Namco’s Tales series has been one of the most consistent JRPG franchises. My first taste was in 2004 with Tales of Symphonia, and that was a wonderful experience. I haven’t played every game in the series (there are a few duds it seems), but since Symphonia, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed Abyss, Vesperia, Graces, and most recently, Xillia. In a month, Tales of Xillia 2 will be released. I found Xillia to be a solid entry and the sequel is very, very well-regarded. RPG Fan has a <a href="http://rpgfan.com/previews/Tales_of_Xillia_2/">great preview</a> on the game; here are my main (and somewhat irreverent) takeaways.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Ludger [the protagonist] can switch between three weapon types (dual blades, a hammer, and a gun) to fight his enemies effectively at any distance.”</em> Finally! Some game designer realized that the best weapon isn’t a sword, or even two swords, but two swords, a sledgehammer, AND dual-wielded pistols. Genius!</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/weapons.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Where will cosplayers keep the extra weapons?</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><em>“He can also transform into a demi-humanoid using the power of ‘Chromatus,’ dramatically augmenting his strength and ability repertoire.”</em> Yes!!! Not only does he wield three different kinds of weapons, he can also GO SUPER SAIYAN!</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/saiyan.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Just SAIYAN!</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><em>“The Double Raid Linear Motion Battle System (DR-LMBS) returns as well.”</em> The awesome battle system in the Tales series is a cornerstone of the series, but I never realized how ridiculous they name the system.</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/battle.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The Double Raid...ehh, screw it. This is the battle system in action.</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Ludger and Elle are injured during a train hijacking early in the game, and a mysterious man takes advantage of their plight by paying their medical bills and putting Ludger into astronomical debt.”</em> Sounds like Ludger and Elle don’t live on Elympios, but in the United States of America given the ruinous amount of medical debt they were able to incur. Running with that theory, it also sounds like the TSA should start securing our train systems.</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-10/debt.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>20 million gald!? They must've spent a week and a half in the hospital!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Irreverence aside, August 19th can’t come soon enough because I’m super excited to dive in Tales of Xillia 2.</p>

        ChucK Meets Travis
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>Ge, Spencer, and I sometimes talk about our dreams when we’re playing StarCraft. During the small windows of time when we’re not playing StarCraft, we’re all making some sort of headway towards our dreams. Today, one of those dreams has come to pass. <strong>ChucK is now set up for continuous integration on Travis.</strong> Every commit to ChucK triggers Travis to check that ChucK compiles and passes a suite of unit tests.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-06/madness.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>Who’s Travis? Travis is a free (for public repositories) hosted continuous integration service. With zero knowledge of Travis (but plenty of tears shed dabbling in release engineering at Smule), it only took an hour to get everything set up and running. You add one file to your repository (.travis.yml) and set up your scripts in there; it’s straightforward and <strong>just works</strong>. They say you get what you pay for, so I feel kind of bad because Travis is so good I feel like someone is getting robbed. How good is it? It builds and tests pull requests! Gone are the days where you would have to meticulously review the changes you were about to pull into your project. If Travis THINKS it’s okay, you KNOW it’s okay. But, perhaps double-checking isn’t a bad idea!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-07-06/travis_1604.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>travis.yml file that supports both Linux and Mac</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Travis has a multi-platform feature that’s in beta, and we’re already taking full advantage of that to run our tests on both Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) and Mac (Mavericks 10.9.2). When Travis  adds more platform and OS configurations, we’ll run (not walk) to get those configurations set up. And while the current 150+ tests are a great start for unit testing, we’re looking to expand testing to make it more thorough and exhaustive. ChucK has a pretty awesome user community that is good at pushing ChucK to the limits (and occasionally breaking it), so we see a future filled with more tests, and consequently a greater and more stable (i.e. more stable than incredibly stable) ChucK.</p>
