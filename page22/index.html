        iOS Keyboard Addendum

    <p>A few weeks ago, I wrote a <a href="2014/06/10/ios-keyboard-woes/">post</a> pointing out (i.e. complaining about) how iOS 7 broke the keyboard’s shift key. A coworker pointed out that the shift key really didn’t break in iOS 7 (released September 2013), but rather in iOS 7.1 (released March 2014). Android aside, I think iOS 6 still has the best shift key, but iOS 7.0’s shift key at least makes some sense. Here is a more complete picture depicting the shift key’s deterioration.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see how much “better” they make the shift key in iOS 8!</p>

    <p>The new Facebook Slingshot app is like SnapChat with a twist: you can only see a photo or video someone has sent if you if send them something back first. It’s pretty cool. I’m not here to wax poetic about the potential merits of the “send me content back or you can’t see what I sent you” mechanic, but I do get slightly irked when I take all of <strong>5 seconds</strong> to craft a crappy SnapChat only to NEVER hear back from the poor sap who wasted 10 seconds looking at it.</p>

<p>My biggest question about Slingshot is: can we just bypass this whole locked content stuff?</p>

<div>

<p>Turns out you can. Just configure your device to use an SSL proxy like <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a> and check out the calls made to <strong>https://api.parse.com/update</strong> and <strong>https://api.parse.com/client_function</strong>. Look in the JSON array keyed by “lockedShotUsers” and you should see something like this. Note: the JSON body was trimmed to just show the essentials.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a video taken by my mentor and hero, Tom Lieber a.k.a. <a href="http://www.alltom.com">alltom.com</a>, playing Super Smash Bros. Yes, I didn’t reply to him. Yes, he called me a cheater and made me feel a little bad about this breach of Slingshot etiquette.</p>

<p>Does this matter? Not really. You could make it so the content URL isn’t sent down until you send content to someone else, but you don’t get a lot by cheating here. You’ll see what your friend sent you and have a little evil laugh. The main operating principle for the system still holds – if you want more content, you’re gonna have to make and share content. But if a friend says send me a picture of your credit card and I promise to send a picture of mine to unlock yours, you may want to ignore them.</p>

        E3 2014 Postmortem
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>E3 2014 has come and gone. A lot of exciting announcements were made by console juggernauts - Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo - and big publishers like EA and Ubisoft. A lot of exciting games were revealed as well. People craving information on an upcoming game that they’ve been looking forward to may have gotten some information to kindle even more excitement. Everyone has their opinion as to who put on the best show at E3. The victor in my eyes was easy to choose because <strong>Nintendo absolutely killed it this year</strong>.</p>

<p>We got a vague 2015 release window for what should be an amazing JRPG, <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X</strong>, as well a ridiculous amount of gameplay footage. The 30-second teaser for a new open-world (Skyrim-esque) <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> for the Wii U has me shaking at the knees. There’s also a new <strong>Star Fox</strong> and a totally brand-new IP, <strong>Splatoon</strong>, that looks very, very fun and has the potential to ruin many friendships, like the also announced <strong>Mario Party 10</strong>. The user-content-generating <strong>Mario Maker</strong> could add nearly infinite replay-ability to the classic platformer. In addition to <strong>Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</strong> which will likely sell like hotcakes, <strong>Code Name S.T.E.A.M.</strong> is another game to keep an eye out for. Made by Intelligent Systems (the team behind Advance Wars) with some serious involvement from Hitoshi Yamagami (Xenoblade, Fire Emblem, Pokemon), this new game has an all-star cast working on it.</p>

<p>Reviewing the list of announcements, I discovered even more exciting stuff that I missed during Nintendo’s magical barrage of wonderful news. It’s looking like Nintendo is finally firing on all cylinders (except Metroid!) to make the Wii U a strong contender in the latest console war, while also bolstering the already-strong 3DS library.</p>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>I’m sad to say my wildest WWDC fantasy did not come true last week. After Tim Cook and team unveiled a slew of new APIs, a new programming language, OS X Yosemite, and iOS 8, which includes <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/quicktype/">a new, cooler keyboard</a>, I was hoping the time of reckoning was upon us. Alas, I was wrong. <strong>iOS 8 does not fix the keyboard’s shift key.</strong></p>

<p>But wait! What’s wrong with the shift key? I’ll tell you what. I’m having a hard time determining when the shift key is on or off. Think I’m making this up? Give it a shot yourself!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-06-10/quiz.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Is shift key enabled on the left or right?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Answer: the shift key is enabled on the left, disabled on the right. I asked some friends and coworkers and I’m not the only one who got this question wrong. What’s most upsetting and downright disappointing is things were a lot better in iOS 6.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-06-10/ios6-comparison.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>It's a lot easier on iOS 6.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Easy. It’s on when it’s lit up, and it’s off when it’s not. But you know what’s even better than iOS 6? Here comes a <strong>special</strong> moment where Android does something better than iOS.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-06-10/android-comparison.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Shockingly and amazingly straightforward!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>With Android, there isn’t just one key to tell you if the shift key is enabled. When the shift key is enabled all alphabetical characters become capitalized. It’s actually “what you see is what you get.” It’s much more unambiguous and it’s awesome.</p>

<p>Oh wells… There’s always iOS 9.</p>

        Initial Impressions &mdash; Heroes of the Storm

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-06-08/heroes_logo.jpg" /> 
  	<p>I spent a bunch of time this weekend checking out the Alpha of Blizzard's upcoming multiplayer online battle arena game (MOBA), Heroes of the Storm. I know the general idea behind this genre, but I've actually never played a MOBA, so you can say this weekend was my virginal MOBA experience. Here are some of my initial impressions.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The game is fun!</strong> Generally, I had a great time playing. The game is accessible, enjoyable, challenging, and addictive. I mostly played AI comp stomps; playing against other people made the game much more brutal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The maps are really cool.</strong> I’m not sure how other MOBAs work, but every map in Heroes has a different gameplay mechanic that can and should be leveraged to gain a large tactical advantage. For example, on Dragon Shire, a party that can simultaneously control two shrines can then summon a powerful Dragon hero that marches towards the enemy’s camp. It’s refreshing to see maps that differ in more ways than simply their texture.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-06-08/heroes_blackheartbay.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The loading screen explains the map-specific mechanic.</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pick-up groups suck!</strong> This is a team game; it requires some amount of coordination. Playing with random people, it seemed like everyone was just doing their own thing. If our opponents had even a MINIMAL amount of coordination, we got totally wrecked. It reminded me a lot of a 4v4 in StarCraft where everyone just does their own build and everyone hopes it works out in the end. Sometimes it does, but most of the time it doesn’t.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I have no idea what I’m doing.</strong> I’m kind of figuring out what to do and find myself sometimes being a good team player, but – generally – I still have no idea what I’m doing. Fortunately, this can be remedied by playing more frequently, and playing with people who can show you the ropes. This is mostly just an apology to all my MOBA-playing friends who I will invariably frustrate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m eagerly anticipating the release of Heroes, mostly because that means I’ll be able to cajole four other friends to play with me.</p>
