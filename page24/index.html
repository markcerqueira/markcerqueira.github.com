        How I Do Email
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2014</span>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">We're drowning in email. Good people look like terrible people when they can't keep afloat when hit by wave after relentless wave of email. Everyone has a strategy for dealing with email. Some people just don't care, and getting a timely reply (or a reply at all) from them is a matter of luck. Some people, like robots, manage email with a furious efficiency. I like to believe I've come up with a halfway decent strategy to managing email. Generally, my strategy has two goals:</p>

<p><b>1. Minimize the amount of mail that reaches my inbox.</b><br />
<b>2. Track emails that require future attention.</b></p>

<p>Read on to find out how I beat back the evil of too much freaking email.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Note: I use Gmail and some Gmail-specific functionality. If you don’t use Gmail, this may not directly apply to you.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-30/filters.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Abusing Gmail's Filters to keep the inbox less busy.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>First, I <strong>minimize the amount of email that actually reaches my inbox</strong>. Why? Because if something hits my inbox (and I subsequently get a push notification on my phone), I want the message to actually be important. This is less about keeping up with email and more about disconnecting a little more from the constant connectedness everyone is subjected to these days. I abuse Gmail’s Filters and Labels. Anytime, something lands in my inbox that I feel should not have landed there, I update my Filters to grab those emails, automatically label them, and have them bypass my inbox. The image above shows how ridiculous this has become, but it’s good at keeping stuff out of my inbox. This seems to be where Gmail wants to go with its new inbox tabs (e.g. Primary, Social, Promotions), but this solution lets me have complete control over the filtering.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of labels for Smule stuff, a Money label for financial stuff, and the general Non-Critical label that grabs everything else. <strong>If it’s important, it should land in my inbox. If it’s not, it can wait until later.</strong> Since I started hardcore-filtering, I went from 30+ emails landing in my inbox everyday to less than 10. And no one has yet to complain (to me at least) about my email etiquette.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-30/inbox.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Multiple inboxes to keep track of emails that need to be kept around.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>And then I want to keep <strong>track of emails that require future attention</strong>. For this, I use Gmail’s star feature and the Multiple Inboxes lab plugin. Messages can get tagged with one of three star colors: red for emails that require a reply or attention (i.e. a to-do item), green for receipts that I need to submit for reimbursement, and purple for emails I’ll need at some point in the future (e.g. race sign-up information, flight confirmations).</p>

<p>Then I can <strong>easily follow up on all three groups since they’re right there next to my inbox</strong> thanks to Multiple Inboxes. I try to keep the to-do list (red) as short as possible. I can quickly figure out what I need to submit for reimbursement by looking at the list of emails tagged with a green star. And when my parents ask me what time my flight gets in, there is no need for me to search my inbox; I can just look at the messages tagged with a purple star.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, I’m not a celebrity or some company executive, but if I was, I believe this strategy could scale to a point where I wouldn’t need to hire someone to manage my email, calendar, or visits to the bathroom.</p>

        On Indiegogo's Design Update
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Indiegogo recently updated the design of their webpage. As with any change, people have opinions and I’ve got some myself.</p>

<div>
	<img style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/indie.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The old (left) and new (right) design of the contribute panel.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Full disclosure: I am not a designer, and do not purport myself to be one. But I do have feelings about this design that may or may not be grounded in sound design principles. To be safe, just consider me a guy with an opinion (dangerous) and enough time to put said opinions on the Internet (extremely dangerous).</p>

<!--break-->

<div>
	<img style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/like-1.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Flexible funding and funding duration separated in the new design.</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Like</strong> - In the new design, they hid the explanation of what Flexible Funding is behind a question mark. In the old design, the explanation for flexible funding was awkward, because it was an explanation of what flexible funding is, followed by the funding duration which is independent of flexible funding. The new design floats the funding duration explanation up and separates the two (i.e. what the funding duration is and what flexible funding is).</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/dislike-1.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Thin and blending into the background is in style.</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dislike</strong> - The text color. Holy crap this is so annoying because it makes no sense to me and everyone seems to be doing it these days. Why are people making fonts thinner and more similar in color to the background!? Who thought having a thin, light grey font on a white background is a good idea? Do you want to make it hard for me to read the text? BECAUSE IT DOES. If it’s information that’s less important and you don’t want to call attention to it, just get rid of it. Don’t freaking camouflage it.</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/like-2.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The new design brings all the text together.</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Like</strong> - In the old design, the elements explaining how far along something was funded was: text amount of money raised, bar indicating percentage raised, and text of the total amount desired. It seems a bit disjointed because you would read it as “x dollars raised,” then here’s a pretty picture that indicates some percentage towards completion, followed by “out of y dollars.” The new design floats all the text up, and puts the graph at the bottom. From top to bottom it now reads as “x dollars raised out of y,” (red box) followed by a picture to show you this information (blue box).</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<img style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0.80em;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-24/indifferent-1.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>These days, all the COOL buttons are FLAT.</strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Indifferent</strong> - The new, FLATTER contribute button. Flat design is all the rage these days, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say it: “I don’t see what the big freaking deal about flat everything is.”</li>
</ul>

<p>So there we have it. Frightened readers (or lovers of flat buttons and hard-to-read text) should be comforted by the fact that I’m only a software developer and not a designer!</p>

        Recovering from Heartbleed
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Apr 2014</span>

    <div class="float-image-right">	
  	<img style="border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-22/heartbleed.png" /> 
  	<p>It turns out the backbone of secure communication across the Internet has had a catastrophic bug &mdash; Heartbleed &mdash; in it for the past two years. Yikes! One of the most frightening things about Heartbleed is no one really knows if the bug was ever exploited. Were some evil Communist people doing nefarious, Un-American things? Was a popular US information agency snooping on you to keep you safe? No one knows.<br /><br />
	
	As always, it's best to err on the side of caution. If you've been getting emails from banks and online services recommending you change your passwords, it's because Heartbleed. That said, I think most people didn't even need Heartbleed to be in a compromised situation because quite frankly, most people suck at managing their security. Let's talk passwords!</p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p>Here’s what I think a lot of people’s password situation is like: <strong>one password that is used everywhere.</strong> I don’t blame people for not having a unique password for every service because who could remember all those? Even with mnemonics, it’s hard to remember a ton of passwords. You can try to get cute with your passwords, but if myAwesomeLinkedInPassword is your LinkedIn password, I have a pretty good idea what your Amazon password is going to be.</p>

<p>So you don’t need Heartbleed to compromise your security on the Internet; all you need is <strong>one</strong> service to get hacked. From there, hackers will have a field day if you used that password elsewhere. Some people have different levels of password: one password they use for sites they don’t care about and a different password used only for important services. But this is still unsafe: one compromised “important service” and all your important services are at risk.</p>

<p>What am I getting at here? <strong>Use a password manager.</strong> A password manager lets you easily have unique passwords for every service you use, and it lets you make passwords as complex as possible. <a href="http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/rshay/pubs/passwords_and_people2011.pdf">A recent study</a> shows that the length of a password is more important than the composition (e.g. one symbol, one number, one upper-case letter). So make your passwords as long as possible, and make them unique. With a password manager, you won’t need to know what your password is; just let the manager fill in all the info for you. I use and like 1Password (a somewhat questionable name for a product that encourages having many different passwords), but you can take your pick at the many that are out there. <strong>Make your passwords hard to crack (long passwords) and make sure a compromised service doesn’t compromise any other services (unique passwords)</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-22/1password.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Use 1Password to manage hundreds of passwords!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>How did I recover from Heartbleed? My 1Password database has over 700 logins in it! I wasn’t going to update all of them, so I went through the entire list and made a folder of Important items. That list ended up containing a much more manageable 70 items. From there, <strong>it took me an hour to update all of my important logins</strong>. Boom! Done. I never knew the original passwords, and I don’t know the new ones either. But I can tell you they are all unique and as long as possible. If there is ever another Heartbleed-level security compromise, I’ll go through my Important folder and update the passwords once again.</p>

<p>If one service ever gets compromised, or in the case of Heartbleed — over half the internet — you shouldn’t have a sinking feeling in your stomach. No worries about your Facebook friends that are about to get spammed and no worries about your bank account that may be having its funds drained. Be prepared — start using a password manager. This isn’t fear-mongering. You don’t have to look too far into the past to find large companies like LinkedIn and Adobe leaking millions of users’ credentials.</p>

<p>And while we’re here, I’d be remiss not to discuss that <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">xkcd on password strength</a>. “correct horse battery staple” is a better password than “Tr0ub4dor&amp;3,” but you know what’s ridiculously (like trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions) better than both of these? This wonderful abomination: “68qeu3Raj72e3db6upNFekivUf8688T”. Here’s how long the <a href="https://passfault.appspot.com/password_strength.html">Passfault Analyzer</a> says it would take to crack each of these passwords:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tr0ub4dor&amp;3 - <strong>less than 1 day!</strong></li>
  <li>correct horse battery staple - <strong>1 year, 11 months</strong></li>
  <li>8qeu3Raj72e3db6upNFekivUf8688T - <strong>935,300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, that’s a ridiculous amount of time. The universe itself is <strong>only</strong> 14,000,000,000 years old. If you think the universe is only 6,000 years old, this is <strong>EVEN MORE</strong> impressive. And best of all, I don’t need to think about a stupid horse, battery, staples, or how correct one of them might be. I don’t need to think at all; let a computer program do what it does best and remember things for you.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-22/jack_bauer.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Not even this man can get your passwords out of you!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Also - the most important benefit of not knowing any of your passwords is actually not knowing them. So when Jack Bauer bursts into your house and demands you tell him the password to your Communist Nuclear Control Dashboard, you can tell him you honestly don’t know. Huzzah!</p>

        Smackathon 2014 - Magic Piano on the PS Vita
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Today wrapped up Smule’s first Smackathon (a Smulean hackathon) of 2014. Armed with clairvoyant vision and a burning desire to be amazing, The Backstreet Trolls (me and Josh Wu) set out to port the popular Magic Piano to the PlayStation Vita.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/running.jpg" />

</div>

<p>Sony provides development tools for building and running applications on a Vita. The language of choice is C#, which provided a nearly seamless transition for someone coming from Android (Java) development. Contrary to its name, C# is actually more like Java than C. Fortunately, Sony also provides a bunch of great examples we were able to mess around with. The IDE – PlayStation Mobile Studio – wasn’t great. It confounded us many times with odd behavior and unhelpful error messages. When you think Eclipse is a better IDE, you know you’ve got some problems.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/ide.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>A weak IDE, but the Simulator wasn't half bad.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Josh took care of everything audio. For the actual piano sounds, we implemented a system similar to the Android version of Magic Piano: we played sounds from a bank of sound files. Josh also handled converting some songs into a format that our application could parse. I took care of the rest: reading in the music files Josh wrote up, placing the notes on the screen, and making them fall gracefully down the screen. Within a day, we had a prototype.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/troll-mode.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Troll Mode enabled!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>With 24 hours left, we knew that there was much room for improvement. I took the the road more travelled and made tweaks to gameplay, optimized texture loading and sprite rendering,  and <i>*gasp*</i> refactored and cleaned up our code to make it more maintainable and extendable. But Josh took the road less traveled. I added a button for enabling “troll mode,” and let Josh run wild. In troll mode, the images representing notes became Smule employees making troll faces, and the piano sounds were all replaced with us singing our approximation of said notes. He took the road less traveled, and it made all the difference.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="/assets/images/posts/2014-04-18/backstreet-trolls.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>The Backstreet Trolls with Magic Piano for PS Vita!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Our project was awesome. All the Smuleans put in great effort and it’s pretty spectacular what we all produced in such a short amount of time. The Backstreet Trolls are eagerly looking forward to the next Smackathon, which will close out what should be an eventful 2014!</p>

      <a href="/2014/03/20/5-ways-to-static-in-java/">
        5 Ways to Static in Java
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>Someone asked me the other day if I knew about all the usages of static in Java. Turns out, I didn’t know them all! Let’s review them.</p>

<p>1. <strong>Static methods</strong> - Methods of class can be static or non-static. Non-static methods are called instance methods because they can only be invoked on an instance of the particular class they belong to. Static methods can be called without any instance.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>2. <strong>Static variables</strong> - Like static methods, static variables do not belong to instances of a class. If you have a static variable, its value is global and shared. Instance variables require an instance of the class; static variables do not.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Nested static classes</strong> - Sometimes you have a class that is only useful to one class so you nest it in another class. This nested class can be static or non-static. If the nested class is static, it cannot directly access instance variables of the outer class that contains it. If the nested class is non-static it is called an inner class. Instances of inner classes can only exist within instances of the outer class that contains them.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Static initializers</strong> - Static initializers are blocks of code that are executed (top-down) when the class is loaded. As the name implies, they can be used to initialize things in a static context. For example, if you have a JSON mapper class (as seen below) with a static ObjectMapper, you can configure it when the class is invoked, rather than having to call an initialization method.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">JsonUtils</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="n">ObjectMapper</span> <span class="n">sObjectMapper</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ObjectMapper</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">sObjectMapper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">configure</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">JsonParser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Feature</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ALLOW_SINGLE_QUOTES</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>5. <strong>Static imports</strong> - A static import allows you to refer to fields and members of a class without actually specifying the class. For example, if you wanted to access the value of Pi in the Math class, you would normally do this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">java.lang.Math</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">pi</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">PI</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But if you don’t want to specify that PI is in the Math class you can do a static import:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">static</span> <span class="n">java</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">lang</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">PI</span>

<span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">pi</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">PI</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is useful in certain cases, but if abused, can make code harder to read since magical constants of mysterious origin may be referenced without too much context.</p>

<p><strong>How did I do?</strong> I knew the first three, and was prodded into the fourth one since I had used it a few times previously. I had absolutely no idea about static imports. Then again, my amazing development tool of choice, IntelliJ, handles importing any and every file I need.</p>
