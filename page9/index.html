        Online Money Security
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>My parents aren’t super comfortable with technology. They didn’t grow up with computers and they still don’t use them that much. My mom only recently got a smartphone and – besides typical phone stuff – only uses Facebook. It still blows their minds how much we can do online. From the comfort of home we can see pictures from around the world, deposit checks, check the detailed history of a bank account, check their retirement plans and Social Security benefits, send other people money, and see lots of pictures of cats.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-11-20/cmoney.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Is money safe in the cloud!?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Given their unfamiliarity with technology they do have one very legitimate concern that comes up frequently whenever financial matters are involved: is this safe? The answer: <strong>it depends</strong>. Threats are constantly evolving, but you can take steps to keep yourself protected.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Practice good basic computer security.</strong> I’ve written about how to <a href="http://mark.gg/2015/09/22/computer-security-basics/">improve your computer security</a>. Those are helpful here, specifically the tips on passwords and two-factor authentication which basically boil down to don’t reuse passwords and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Register for an account with the IRS and Social Security Administration (SSA).</strong> This is a clear case against the argument “if I don’t create an account, I’m safe.” Why these two accounts in particular? A fraudster can create accounts in your name and then file tax returns with the IRS and claim your benefits with the SSA. To add to this trouble privacy regulations (intended to protect you) will protect the fraudsters instead! Unfortunately this is not unfounded fear-mongering. Security expert Brian Krebs <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/03/sign-up-at-irs-gov-before-crooks-do-it-for-you/">wrote about a victim</a> who had an IRS account created by fraudsters and the subsequent harrowing experience. <strong>NOTE</strong>: The IRS has <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Statement-on-the-Get-Transcript-Application">temporarily suspended</a> creating online accounts in light of the unauthorized fraudulent activity described in the post by Krebs. So for now, just <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/RIL/SiView.do">sign up for an account with the SSA</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep an eye on your credit with CreditKarma.</strong> It’s good to keep an eye on your credit report. <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/">CreditKarma</a> is an easy (and free) way to keep tabs on your credit. If someone opens a credit card in your name, you want to know as soon as possible. CreditKarma will email you if it finds a new account listed on your credit report. CreditKarma will also give you your credit score, which is a great to know given its large impact on interest rates of loans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Aggregate all your finances with Mint.</strong> <a href="http://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> makes tracking your bank accounts, credit cards, investment accounts, and loans simple by putting all that information in one place. I think asking someone to log into multiple websites to verify everything looks good is a harder sell than asking them to check everything in a single place. Mint also gives you an ever useful high-level view of your financial situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set up a firewall checking account.</strong> We share and use our checking account information for all sorts of things like PayPal, Venmo, electronic rent payment, and online credit card payments to name a few. A firewall checking account is an account that you connect all these external services (also potential attack vectors) to. You keep only the amount you need in this account so in case of a compromise, you don’t lose access to much money. Behind the firewall account, you can safely keep the rest of your money in other accounts that are not externally exposed. You can read more about firewall checking accounts on the <a href="http://www.mymoneyblog.com/setting-up-buffer-firewall-bank-accounts.html">MyMoneyBlog</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully that gets you feeling more comfortable about money matters online. If I got something terribly wrong or somehow offended you, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/markmcerqueira">send me an angry tweet</a>!</p>

        Data Plans, Mysterious Fruits, and Ice Cream!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>This past August, Verizon reworked their wireless data plan offerings. Here’s how they sold them.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px solid #555555;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-11-09/before.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>My thoughts?</p>

<ul>
  <li>What fruit is used for the 3 GB plan? My best guess is a hairless coconut. Also, why does this mysterious fruit not cast a shadow like the other fruits?</li>
  <li>The “Best for” cases will only confuse customers. What does it mean to use “Facebook once in a while?” Am I a “gamer” needing extra data if all I play is offline games? And then there’s the stupid obvious: of course “big-time data users” pick the beefiest plan.</li>
  <li>Why are the leaves of the pineapple clipped on top!?</li>
  <li>The fruit analogy is a bit forced. Yes, a watermelon is heavier than an orange. But fruits have varying prices per pound. For example, take a watermelon and a weight-equivalent amount of avocados; the avocados will cost more. You’re literally comparing apples to oranges, but the apples are watermelons in this case. That said, if you overanalyze everything, everything is a bit forced.</li>
</ul>

<p>I took a screenshot of this and months later finally sat down to write this post. Fortunately, revisiting this page today I saw Verizon made many positive tweaks to this page!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; border: 0px solid #555555;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-11-09/after.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone knows this absolute truth: ice cream is one of the best things ever. Fruit is nice, but ice cream is infinitely better. For the record, if the new version had used vegetables, I’d lose it.</li>
  <li>My guess at the flavors: Strawberry, French Vanilla, Matcha Green Tea, Blueberry, and Vanilla Bean.</li>
  <li>The header changed from “One plan. Four sizes.” to “One plan. Pick a size.” Adding a call to action helps guide users to the ultimate goal: helping them pick a data plan.</li>
  <li>Using scoops of ice cream to differentiate plans is simple and natural. More scoops means you get more ice cream, but you’ll pay more. Everyone’s gone through this experience (some more than others) when buying ice cream.</li>
  <li>Scoops are also just more aesthetically pleasing. They are coherent. A single scoop of Strawberry next to a double scoop of Strawberry and Vanilla will always look more natural versus a watermelon sitting next to a pineapple.</li>
  <li>The “Best for” in the original version was a brave, but foolish endeavor. Removing it completely was a good move.</li>
  <li>Some people will always go with the most expensive option and Verizon loses nothing someone uses 1 GB of the 18 GB XXL plan. Adding an XXL option will impact revenue in positive ways.</li>
  <li>I don’t like chocolate, but most people love chocolate. Is there a kindred chocolate-hater on the Verizon team that refused to add a scoop of chocolate to even their 5-scoop XXL cone!?</li>
  <li>As scoops are added across plans, the new scoops somehow magically get added UNDER the previous scoop. See how 1 GB is a scoop of Strawberry, but 3 GB has a scoop of French Vanilla UNDER (and not OVER) the scoop of Strawberry? It’s a bit unnatural and quite unnerving for this ice cream lover.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short: I thought the fruity implementation was a bad joke, but I’m actually quite fond of and impressed with the ice cream implementation. It works well. Kudos to the Verizon design team!</p>

        Google Calendar and Mortality

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>Do seemingly random things ever hit unexpected places in unexpected ways?</p>

<p>I have a Birthday calendar that I use to keep track of family and friend’s birthdays. It’s reliable because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Birthdays don’t (normally) change!</li>
  <li>I don’t have to rely on some social network (and proper privacy settings) to inform me.</li>
  <li>I can add reminders days or weeks ahead of particular birthdays in case I need to get a gift.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding someone’s birthday to my calendar is easy. You create a new event and set it to repeat annually. And then the unexpected part happens:</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #555555;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-11-02/repeating.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>I go with the DENIAL route and pick NEVER.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Wow! Google Calendar just reminded me of a sobering and morbid truth: <strong>everyone dies</strong>. Thanks for that! And double thanks for reminding me of that when I’m thinking about people important enough to be added to my special Birthday calendar.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #555555;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-11-02/feels.gif" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>This calendar hit me right in the feels!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Feeling down? Turn that frown around! It’s Monday! Happy Monday! Be happy please! Come on!</p>

        Madhouse is Killing Anime
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>Sometimes I start watching an anime series and it’s so good, I power through it in a few days. <a href="http://www.funimation.com/shows/overlord/home">Overlord</a> is the most recent anime to hook me so thoroughly I blasted through all 13 episodes in a weekend. While I could sing praises for Overlord, the very clear trend I only recently became aware of is the studio behind Overlord: <strong>Madhouse</strong>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 600px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-10-14/overlord.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong></strong></p>
</div>

<p>To say <strong>Madhouse</strong> has absolutely and consistently been <strong>killing it</strong>, producing top quality anime feels like an understatement. Take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_(company)#Works">list of works by Madhouse</a> and you’ll find anime that are, should be, or will soon be on your favorites list. This list includes gems like Death Note, No Game No Life, Death Parade, Parasyte, Monster, Hellsing Ultimate, Black Lagoon, Hunter x Hunter, and Trigun.</p>

<p>Need a new anime to watch? Take a somewhat unconventional route and start looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_(company)#Works">the Madhouse productions</a> you haven’t watched. Happy Madhousing!</p>

        Hello Tabletop Gaming
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>I’ve recently begun exploring <strong>tabletop gaming</strong> and I’m happy to report my journey so far has been thoroughly enjoyable! Here are two games (one board and one card) that I’m currently hooked on.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-10-04/pandemic.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Our first victory over Pandemic!</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Pandemic</strong> is a cooperative board game (2-4 players) that pits your team against four malevolent diseases, which are conveniently named red, blue, yellow, and black. Players take turns moving between cities and trying to stymie the spread of the various diseases while gathering enough resources to discover respective cures. Discussion among the team is encouraged and a must for victory as coordination is key. It’s a challenging game; it took us four tries to finally win a game! Mechanics in the game make each iteration feel novel and fresh: each person is randomly assigned a role that gives them special perks (e.g. a medic can cure diseases in a town faster) and how diseases spread are determined from a shuffled (random) deck of cards.</p>

<p>There are several expansions to <strong>Pandemic</strong> that increase the challenge in this already challenging game. If this sounds daunting, I still definitely recommend getting the <strong>On The Brink</strong> expansion from the get-go as it includes much-needed dishes and trays for organizing all the tokens and disease cubes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Z-Man-Games-ZMG-71100-Pandemic/dp/B00A2HD40E">Pandemic</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CAG5LJ2/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444003506">On The Brink</a> will run you about $50, but I’ve found it a worthwhile investment!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-10-04/monopoly.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>The end of a Monopoly Deal game.</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Monopoly Deal</strong> is a faster way to play Monopoly. You’ll acquire property, charge rent, put houses and hotels down, screw over friends, and probably lose friends. But it won’t take more than 15 minutes to accomplish all this and all you need to carry around is a deck of 110 cards! You win when you can acquire three complete sets of a property color.</p>

<p>As with regular Monopoly, your <del>friends</del> mortal enemies will be looking to deplete your bank, take your property, and inflict permanent damage to your soul. Luck is certainly useful when drawing cards from a shuffled deck. But I’ve also lost consistently enough times that some strategy (that I’m unaware of) must be at play! Purchasable today for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-B0965-Monopoly-Deal-Card/dp/B00NQQTZCO">under $5</a>, getting this game won’t break the bank!</p>
