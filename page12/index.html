        All Hail the Angel Soft!

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 May 2015</span>

    <p>During my visit to South Korea in 2013, I discovered the Korean bakery Tous les Jours and their wonderfully amazing THE+ Milk Bread. But I think I found a new pastry to claim the title of <strong>Mark’s Favorite Baked Thing</strong>! How did this fortuitous discovery happen?</p>

<p>First, visit one of the 255 <strong>Vie de France</strong> cafés in Japan.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/vie-de-france.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Vie de France at Tameikesanno Station</strong></p>
</div>

<!--break-->

<p>As you enter, bask in the wonderful aroma of baked goods… And pray to the Baked Good Gods that they have <strong>Angel Soft</strong> in stock.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/angelsoft.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>So angelically soft...</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Yes – you read right. <strong>ANGEL SOFT – APPLE &amp; CHEESE CREAM!!!</strong> It is a wonderful baked good – some may call it a gift from God – that is heavenly soft bread filled with pieces of apple and cream cheese (or cheese cream). We are truly blessed to live in this day and age.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/angelsoft2.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>So divine...</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Grab a tray and tongs, and grab one or two or all of the Angel Softs. To balance your meal, you may want to pick one of Vie de France’s small <strong>sausage sandwiches</strong>. You’ll want to try all of them at some point, but don’t forget – the star of the show here is Angel Soft!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/hotdogs.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>Which one will share a tray with Angel Soft!?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>You gotta pay before you eat. If you’re a バカ がいじん (baka gaijin, idiot foreigner) like me, just grab all the coins you have in your hand and start slowly picking out coins. The friendly servers behind the counter will throw you a bone and help you out by showing you the right coins to give them. Now that’s service!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/balanced.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>A balanced breakfast!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Sit down and bask in the glory of what’s in front of you. You obviously need to eat the sausage sandwich first because <strong>YOU AWLAYS SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST!</strong> You rush through the sausage sandwich because who has time for a sausage sandwich when Angel Soft is sitting there right in front of you, waiting to be enjoyed!? You finish the sandwich… And now it’s time. You bite into Angel Soft…</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 660px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-20/inside.jpg" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>So soft, so creamy, so apple, so angel soft.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>And what else did you expect? <strong>It’s perfect!</strong> おいしいです (oishīdesu, delicious)! The bread is soft. The cream cheese is there, but not overwhelming. It’s not scary American cream cheese, it’s Japanese cheese cream, in both amount and texture. A piece of an apple will appear here and there, teasing you to bite some more for maybe another piece of apple if you’re lucky. And then it’s over… And you feel like a million bucks for only 160 yen!</p>

<p>See you tomorrow, dearest Angel Soft. I don’t know what I’m going to do when I leave Japan.</p>

      <a href="/2015/05/14/gaijin-tips-for-japan/">
        Gaijin Tips for Japan
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2015</span>

    <p>こんにちは (Konnichiwa, Hello)! It’s been nearly a week since I arrived in Japan and it’s been a blast so far. I’m spending this week and next working (and eating) at the Evernote office in Minato-ku, Tokyo. The following two weeks I will be taking some time off to explore Japan and watch the 16th World Kendo Championships!</p>

<p>My experience has been greatly enhanced by helpful friends, fellow Evernoters, and my kendo family of kohai, senpai, and sensei. Here are a collection of potentially useful tips if you are planning on traveling to Japan!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get a JR Pass if you’re planning on traveling outside of Tokyo.</strong> A JR Pass will give you unlimited access to most of the JR train systems. They are available only to foreigners and are meant to encourage tourism to the Japanese world outside of Tokyo. You’ll also need to buy it BEFORE you get to Japan. They sell them in different lengths of time (7 days, 14 days, 21 days) and they are a bit pricey: a 7 day pass currently costs $236. But it pays for itself pretty quickly; if you’re planning to visit Kyoto, you’ll be coming out ahead already. There are a few places to purchase the JR Pass but I just got mine <a href="http://www.japan-rail-pass.com/">online</a>. I ordered mine Sunday night and got it Tuesday morning!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get a Charles Schwab Checking Account.</strong> This is generally useful advice. Carrying a ton of money around with you while traveling is annoying. Not getting ripped off while converting currency can also be difficult. A Schwab Checking Account makes all this easier. Just land at your destination and hit up the ATM. Worried about those ATM fees? Don’t worry – you’ll get all your ATM fees refunded! It’s pretty amazing. Read more about it on <a href="https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account/checking_account_faqs">Schwab’s website</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get a PASMO card.</strong> You can buy a PASMO card at most train stations. This rechargeable card will let you zip through Tokyo Metro subway station gates and is also usable at コンビニ (konbini, convenience stores) like 7-Eleven. Note, the Tokyo Metro system is separate from the JR system, but it’s <a href="http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/types/regular/index.html">incredibly affordable</a>. A short ride (1km - 6km) will cost $1.42 (170 yen) and on the other end a long ride (28km - 40km) will cost $2.58 (310 yen). What a steal!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--break-->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dealing with the yen to dollar conversion.</strong> Generally speaking, <strong>100 yen is 1 dollar</strong>, so 1000 yen = 10 dollars, 10,000 yen = 100 dollars, and so on. Right now the dollar is strong and the yen is weak, so American visitors will see their dollar fetch them nearly 120 yen! You can chop off the last two zeroes of a yen price to get a rough dollar approximation. An American friend, who lives in Japan, suggested a clever trick of simply adding the cents separator to yen prices which effectively chops off two zeroes. For example, 100 yen becomes 1.00. Happy converting!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speaking of yen, always have cash on you!</strong> I always imagined Japan as a country 20 years ahead of everyone technologically. But cash is king in this country, so don’t expect to use that credit card much. A PASMO card can be used in taxis and convenience stores, but you’ll want cash on you for everything else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get a Pocket Wifi.</strong> Pocket Wifi is a little device that you turn on and it creates a Wifi network for you to connect to the Internet. You could buy a SIM card for your phone but if you’re traveling with others or using multiple devices, a Pocket Wifi is the best way to go as multiple devices can connect to it. The speed and reliability are top notch so far; I’ve even used MapMyRun with a Pocket Wifi to map my runs around Tokyo! There are various places to get them but it’ll cost roughly $3 to $4 per day. But before you buy one read the next tip!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consider using AirBNB to find more affordable housing.</strong> I used AirBNB to book housing for part of my trip. I’m staying in a pretty expensive part of Tokyo – Akasaka, Minato-ku – right now. There are lots of government buildings, embassies, and the Imperial Palace is a few stops away on the subway. Most Japanese friends remark that this area is very expensive, but the place I’m staying at is only $70 a night! Not only is it very affordable, it came with a <strong>Pocket Wifi</strong> to use while I’m staying there! If you don’t have an AirBNB account yet, let me know so I can invite you and we both get free money. :)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Maps is immensely useful.</strong> Just let Google Maps know where you want to go and it’ll let you know which station to walk to, which train to catch, which station to transfer at, and where you need to walk to once you exit the station.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bring a portable USB battery.</strong> If the Pocket Wifi or your phone runs out of battery, stuff can get pretty hairy especially when you’re relying on Google Maps to help you get around. A portable USB battery will let you keep your devices juiced while on the go. No more living from power outlet to power outlet! Larger batteries even have multiple USB ports so you can charge multiple devices at once. I bought this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089DZNS4">Satechi battery</a> nearly two years ago. It has 2 USB ports and I have yet to see the thing run out of power when it’s charging my devices. It is a little on the heavy and large size so you may opt for something a little smaller.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Subway stations are cities below cities.</strong> Some subway stations are ridiculously massive and have multiple entrances/exits. So follow the signs which are fortunately in both Japanese and English to get to the right place once you arrive at a station. The largest of the stations in Tokyo, Shinjuku Station, has over 200 exits and an arcade in it!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hope these tips help anyone looking to travel to Japan!</p>

        Goodbye, Beard

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 May 2015</span>

    <p>It’s been a three-month journey, but today, I (slowly) said goodbye to a dear friend.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-02/beard.png" />

</div>

<p>My college professor and – more importantly – a man with some greats ideas, <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~prc/">Perry Cook</a>, recommended I run this <del>photo of mass destruction</del> work of art through Microsoft’s <a href="http://how-old.net/">How Old Robot</a>.</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-05-02/old-t.png" />

<p>Besides being 10 years off from my actual age, what have we learned about the robot? To be young is to have no facial hair. Full beards make you a bit older. Handlebar mustaches make you look even older (and badass of course). But nothing compares to the aging power of a mean mustache!</p>

<p>Adieu, friend!</p>

        Two Year Bloggiversary

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2015</span>

    <p>One year ago I celebrated <a href="http://mark.gg/2014/05/01/one-year-bloggiversary/">my first bloggiversary</a>. And now – one year later – here we are at the two year bloggiversary! It was a busy year for the blog with <strong>58 posts written</strong> and over <strong>13 thousand pageviews</strong>!</p>

<p>It’s also been a busy year in general. I <a href="http://mark.gg/2014/11/10/hello-world-evernote/"><strong>joined Evernote</strong></a> in November – that’s HALF A YEAR ago! And the fun doesn’t stop: I’ll be heading off to <strong>Japan for a month</strong> this week and will be visiting family in <strong>Portugal in July</strong>.</p>

<p>Goals for this coming year include writing more, working on some open source projects, and trying to get another paper published so I can enhance my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=orfurNwAAAAJ">Google Scholar page</a>.</p>

<p>See you again in May 2016 for another (short and somewhat vain) year-in-review!</p>

        Hard Times Ahead...
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>Today marks the beginning of a difficult and trying time in my life.</p>

<div class="float-image-right">	
  	<p><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X</strong> &mdash; spiritual successor to one of my favorite games Xenoblade Chronicles &mdash; was released in Japan. Unfortunately, Nintendo region locks their consoles and I don't own a Japanese Wii U. And while I can read the name of the game in Japanese &mdash; <strong>ゼ ノ ブ レ イ ド ク ロ ス</strong> &mdash; I doubt that proficiency would get me through the extremely story-driven game. The US version "<strong>is scheduled for release sometime in 2015</strong>." Never has such a nebulous time window haunted me so very much.
	</p>
</div>

<p>I worry that all this anticipation is setting me up for disappointment. What if the game is bad? Everything so far looks good. Xenoblade Chronicles got a 36/40 rating from Famitsu; Xenoblade Chronicles X got a slightly lower, but still respectable 34/40. I’m not worried. Last December, the director of the game, Tetsuya Takahashi, tweeted <a href="http://www.siliconera.com/2014/12/04/xenoblade-chronicles-x-director-says-hes-finally-made-game-always-wanted/"><strong>“15 years have passed since Monolith was founded, and I believe that with this game I have finally met the challenge I had within me, of creating an RPG in which humans and robots can co-exist.”</strong></a> I was hoping his tweet would end more like “creating an RPG that will truly captivate the world, restore people’s faith in the JRPG genre, and usher in a new golden era in Japanese video games,” but I’ll settle for human-robot synergy!</p>

<div>
	<img class="rounded-corners" style="max-width: 700px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px;" src="/assets/images/posts/2015-04-29/xcx_illustration.png" />
	<p class="caption-text" style="line-height: 1.5em;  margin-bottom: 24px;"><strong>I need you now...</strong></p>
</div>

<p>In other news, I leave for Japan next week. I’ll be spending a month there… So that’s one month closer to the end of 2015! This is <strong>positive thinking</strong> people!</p>
